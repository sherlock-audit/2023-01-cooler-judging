# Impossible to defund unless user possess both operator and overseer.

## Summary
Impossible to defund unless user possess both operator and overseer.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is a mistake in the logic of defund. It currently requires the msg.sender to be both operator and overseer. No where in the code or documentation does it reference needing to have both roles to perform key functionality. For the rest of the clearing house contract it actually only accepts one or the other.

## Impact
key functionality in `defund()` is not accessible
