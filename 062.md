# Cooler.request can be called by anyone

## Summary
Cooler.request can be called by anyone. But in case if someone will accept loan, then loan will be sent to the Cooler owner, not request initiator.
## Vulnerability Detail
Cooler.request function is called to create loan request. Currently anyone can call it. At the end requestor [sends collateral amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L85) to Cooler contract.
Once lender calls `clear` then request amount [is sent to owner of Cooler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L179).

This can be incorrectly used and will lead to lose of funds for requestor.

Sponsor said that this is did so in order to allow another flow. Lender creates request and owner clears it, but it's not developed fully now.
In such case, then request should have initiator field and settle function should check that if request initiator is not owner, then only owner can accept it inside clear function.

Currently this works incorrectly and can lead to lose of funds for someone who calls request.
Also, pls, note that once user by mistake created request, he can't cancel it as it can do [only owner of Cooler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L91-L92).
## Impact
Loss of funds for someone who mistakenly calls request function.
