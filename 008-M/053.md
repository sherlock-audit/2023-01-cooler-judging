# ClearingHouse cannot call `Cooler.approve`

## Summary
The `Cooler` contract has the `approve` function which allows a lender to transfer a loan to another lender.
The `ClearingHouse` contract however, which acts as lender for loans, does not have the ability to call `Cooler.approve`.
Therefore any loan that the `ClearingHouse` is the lender of cannot change lenders.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `ClearingHouse` does not implement a way to call `Cooler.approve`.

## Impact
Any loan that the `ClearingHouse` is the lender of cannot change lenders.

## Recommendation
The `ClearingHouse` should implement a `approve` function which calls `Cooler.approve`.
