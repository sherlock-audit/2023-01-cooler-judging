# ERC20 TRANSFERFROM RETURN VALUES NOT CHECKED

## Summary

Some tokens like [EURS](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdb25f211ab05b1c97d595516f45794528a807ad8#code) and [BAT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#code) will not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead. Tokens that don’t actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail

The transferFrom() function returns a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked to see if the transfer has been successful
It is good to use something like OpenZeppelin’s safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

```solidity
    function request (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interest,
        uint256 loanToCollateral,
        uint256 duration
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
...
        //****don't check return value,some tokens unsafe ****//
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
    }
```

## Impact

Users would be able to get loans without collateral token if tokens that don’t revert on failed transfers were used.

use OZ’s SafeERC20’s safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom() function.
