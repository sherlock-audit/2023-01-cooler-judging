# No incentive to pay early

## Summary
Borrower always have to pay interest for full duration even if completes repaying the loan earlier. 

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the `clear` function. The loan amount is set to `req.amount + interest` where interest is taken for full duration. Lets say duration was 6 months

```solidity
function clear (uint256 reqID) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
        ...

        uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
        ...
        loans.push(
            Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
        );
        ...
    }
```

2. User repay all loan in 1 month only, that is 5 month early

```solidity
function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();
        
        uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
        else {
            ...
        }

        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
    }
```

3. As we can see the repay function is expecting full loan amount (including interest for 6 month) even though borrower is paying 5 month early. This mean Borrower paid extra amount which was not even required

## Impact
This causes Borrower to incline towards repaying at last moment itself and promoting more chances of default

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the loan is repaid earlier then interest should be recalculated and interest should only be deducted uptil loan repayment time. A small charge could be taken on prepayment of loan, this will promote borrower to repay early with a small charge instead of multiple month interest
