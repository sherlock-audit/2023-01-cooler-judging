# `Collateral` does not cover `loan.amount + interest`

## Summary
`Collateral` provided by the borrower only covers the base amount of the loan and not the interest.

## Vulnerability Detail
A borrower is supposed to submit a `request` transaction, outlining values which `interest` and `amount` are among them. However, when a borrower requests for a loan, he puts only the collateral for the requested `amount` at the start and the protocol does not provide the lender with any guarantee that he will receive the promised `interest` rate. Therefore, borrowers can convince the lenders with lower collateral and an extremely high interest rate and default the loan after the request is cleared.
The only place where the borrower pays for the interest is in the `roll` transaction where he has to pay for the whole round's interest rate at the end.
