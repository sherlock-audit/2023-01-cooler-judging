# Loss of precision in `collateralFor()`

## Summary
The `collaterFor()` function could result in loss of precision when handling tokens that does not have 1e18 decimals because  it uses the state value of `uint256 private constant decimals=1e18`

## Vulnerability Detail
Because the `collaterFor()` method uses the state value of `uint256 private constant decimals=1e18,` it may cause precision loss when dealing with tokens that lack that has different number of decimal places, such as USDC.

## Impact
Precision loss in the value of `collateralFor()` result in an incorrect amount of collateral

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Handle the different decimals of other tokens properly.
