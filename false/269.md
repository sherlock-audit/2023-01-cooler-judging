# `Cooler.rescind` is vulnerable to frontunning

## Summary
Owner's call to `rescind` may be frontrun by a lender's `clear` transaction. This may cause losses to owner in some cases.

## Vulnerability Detail
Because of relative price movements of `collateral` and `debt` token, the owner may decide to `rescind` a particular request. But lenders will be able to frontun this transaction with a `clear` call, causing the `rescind` call to fail. It will result in the owner being charged interest over the whole loan term.

## Impact
Loss of funds for the owner

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use an expiry time for each request, after which that request couldn't be cleared. 

Alternatively, an oracle can be used to check if the `loanToCollateral` value of the request is within some given bounds of the current price, and make the loan clearable only if it is.
