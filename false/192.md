# Improper ratio of amount requested and collateral might discourage users from using the protocol

## Summary
The mechanism for calculating the collateral for a loan amount might prevent users from using the protocol
## Vulnerability Detail
The mechanism for calculating the collateral For brings different vulnerabilties.
this time it could lead to high amounts for collateral required for a low value loan,
take example 

Joe wants to request a loan of 100 tokens sensibly, joe would want to promise 100 tokens as collateral by passing 100 in the parameter loanToCollateral unknown to joe the mechanism that determines the collateral for a requested loan is flawed
a value of 1000000000000000000 is returned 
joe gets disappointed, then decides to look somewhere else.

## Impact
Protocol abadonment.
