# Gain access of the whole protocol

## Summary
Somebody can gain access to the whole protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
Some bad actors can wait for the protocol to launch on mainnet and create many Cooler pools for different kinds of ERC20 tokens. By doing this, the bad actor can: 1) earn all interest rates from the whole protocol; 2) rescind every loan request and make the protocol non-functional => lose trust; 3) don't rescind/clear any request and the user's funds will be blocked in the Cooler smart contract

As well, the users who already requested a loan and transferred the collateral to the smart contract can't get their funds back until the owner clears or rescind that request

## Impact
The protocol can become a centralized protocol or lose customers (because might be not functional);

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Require the user to transfer a given amount of debt tokens to the newly created Cooler smart contract. Those funds can be withdrawn back after a given amount of days. In this way, if a user wants to create a pool, it needs to buy the token/own the token and transfer it - so the chances to have bad actors would be lower.
