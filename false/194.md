# ClearingHouse admins cannot properly transfer their roles

## Summary

ClearingHouse admins may face trouble due to overly onerous role transfer processes. If one person has both the operator and overseer role, they can only transfer the overseer role and not the operator one.

## Vulnerability Detail

Admins who are both `overseer` and `operator` cannot push just the `operator` role away without also getting rid of their `overseer` role.

## Recommendation

Add a flag to the `push` function signature allowing users to specify which role they mean to push.
