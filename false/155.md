# If a user requests a loan and no one fulfills it, the user's collateral can be stuck forever.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
**Anyone** can call `request` to request a loan, however, only the `owner` of the Cooler is able to rescind the request for a loan.
## Impact
If no one clears the request made by the user, the user's collateral, which was transferred to the contract in `request`, is stuck in the contract. The `rescind` function would revert since the user is not the `owner`. 
Only `owner` can rescind stale requests which is not ideal.

## Recommendation
Consider allowing users to rescind their request if they change their minds.
