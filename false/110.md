# The collateral is transferred to “owner” rather than the lender after the borrower repays their debt.

## Summary

The collateral is transferred to “owner” rather than the lender after the borrower repays their debt.

## Vulnerability Detail

This line of code is incorrect:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L123

The collateral should be transferred to the borrower as they have just repaid their debt after calling the repay() function. In this function the owner is the address inputted in the constructor of the Cooler contract.

## Impact

The borrower does not get any of his collateral back after paying back his debt.
