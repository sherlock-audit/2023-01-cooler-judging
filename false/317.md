# [H] Lenders can always neither agree to nor reject loans, permanently freezing the borrower's collateral

## Summary

The vulnerability is that if a borrower requests a loan and the lender never agrees or declines the loan, the collateral may be locked in the contract indefinitely.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the code snippet provided, the `request()` function allows a borrower to request a loan and transfer collateral to the contract. However, only the owner can call `rescind()` to cancel a loan request and return collateral, if the lender never agrees or declines the loan, the collateral may be locked in the contract indefinitely.

## Impact

This vulnerability can result in the collateral being locked in the contract indefinitely, preventing the borrower from accessing the collateral.

```solidity
function request (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interest,
        uint256 loanToCollateral,
        uint256 duration
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
        requests.push(
            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
        );
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
    }
```

```solidity
function rescind (uint256 reqID) external {
        if (msg.sender != owner) 
            revert OnlyApproved();

        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Rescind);

        Request storage req = requests[reqID];

        if (!req.active)
            revert Deactivated();
        
        req.active = false;
        collateral.transfer(owner, collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
    }
