# Anybody may force an expired loan into default

## Summary

Due to lack of access controls, any actor may transfer a loan's collateral to the lender, even if they are not party to the loan.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `defaulted` function in `Cooler.sol` is unprotected. Therefore anybody may transfer the collateral of an expired loan to the lender, even without the lender's consent.

The `defaulted` function lacks access controls.

## Impact

Lender's funds are moved between accounts without their control.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
Cooler victimCooler = Cooler(address(/* victim addr */));
uint256 expiredLoanId = 0; // pick a loan that is expired, even if we were not involved in it
victimCooler.defaulted(expiredLoanId);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add access controls to the `defaulted` function, such that only the lender may call it.
