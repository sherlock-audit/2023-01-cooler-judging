# Lack of collateral sufficiency check vulnerability

## Bug description

In the request method, the contract calls the `transferFrom` method of the collateral token to transfer the required collateral from the borrower's account to the contract. However, it does not check if the collateral balance is sufficient for the entire duration of the loan, which could lead to a situation where the borrower is unable to repay the loan, and the collateral is lost. This means that even if the borrower has enough collateral at the time of the request, they may not have enough collateral to repay the loan, and the collateral may be lost.

This is the relevant code:
```
function request (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interest,
        uint256 loanToCollateral,
        uint256 duration
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
        requests.push(
            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
        );
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
    }
```

## Impact

This vulnerability can have a significant impact on the functionality of the contract and the overall financial health of the borrowers and lenders. If a borrower is unable to repay the loan, the collateral will be lost which results in a bad debt for the lender. This can have a cascading effect on the entire ecosystem as it could lead to a loss of trust in the contract and reduced participation in the lending process.

## POC
A POC code that demonstrates the "Insufficient collateral check vulnerability" in the Cooler contract can involve creating an instance of the contract, calling the request method with a collateral balance that is insufficient for the duration of the loan, and then checking if the collateral balance is lost. The following is an example of what the POC code could look like:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "./Cooler.sol";

contract InsufficientCollateralPOC {
    Cooler cooler;

    constructor() {
        cooler = new Cooler(msg.sender, ERC20("0x123"), ERC20("0x456"));
    }

    function testInsufficientCollateral() public {
        address borrower = msg.sender;
        uint256 amount = 1000;
        uint256 interest = 2;
        uint256 loanToCollateral = 1;
        uint256 duration = 3600;
        uint256 initialCollateral = 100;

        // approve the contract to transfer collateral
        ERC20(cooler.collateral()).approve(address(cooler), initialCollateral);

        // transfer collateral to the borrower
        ERC20(cooler.collateral()).transfer(borrower, initialCollateral);

        // request a loan
        cooler.request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration);

        // check if the collateral balance is lost
        require(ERC20(cooler.collateral()).balanceOf(borrower) == 0, "Collateral balance should be zero");
    }
}
```

In this POC code, an instance of the Cooler contract is created and a test function testInsufficientCollateral is defined. The function starts by approving the contract to transfer collateral from the borrower's account, then transfers a small amount of collateral to the borrower's account. Then the request method is called with the loan parameters, and the collateral balance of the borrower is checked to see if it's zero or not. If the collateral balance is zero, then the require statement will fail and the message "Collateral balance should be zero" will be shown, this indicates that the collateral is lost and the vulnerability is present.


## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to check if the collateral balance is sufficient for the entire duration of the loan before approving the loan request. This can be achieved by checking the collateral balance of the borrower and comparing it to the loan amount and duration. Additionally, it is recommended to check the collateral balance of the borrower on regular intervals to ensure that the borrower has enough collateral to repay the loan. This can be achieved by adding a function that checks the collateral balance on a regular basis and updates the status of the loan accordingly. 

To further protect the lender, it is recommended to set a minimum collateral ratio to ensure that the lender is protected in case of borrower default. This can be achieved by setting a minimum collateral ratio in the contract to set a minimum collateral ratio in the contract, you can add a new variable in the contract that holds the minimum collateral ratio and check this variable before approving a loan request. 

The following is an example of how you can achieve this:
```
    uint256 public minCollateralRatio;

    constructor (address o, ERC20 c, ERC20 d, uint256 minRatio) {
        owner = o;
        collateral = c;
        debt = d;
        factory = CoolerFactory(msg.sender);
        minCollateralRatio = minRatio;
    }
```
And before approving a loan request, you can check if the collateral ratio is greater than or equal to the minimum ratio.

```
    function request (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interest,
        uint256 loanToCollateral,
        uint256 duration
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        require(loanToCollateral >= minCollateralRatio, "Collateral ratio is too low");
        reqID = requests.length;
        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
        requests.push(
            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
        );
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
    }
```
