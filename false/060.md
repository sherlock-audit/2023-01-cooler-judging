# Inappropriate loan id generation.

## Summary
Inappropriate loan id generation.
## Vulnerability Detail
The loan id depends on the list length which means the same id will be used multiple times since the loan is deleted after being repaid.
## Impact
This leads to some loans being paid without aiming to do so.
For Example :
1. User 1 makes a request for a 1-day loan.
2. A lender clears this request and lends user1.
3. User2 pays this loan without user1 knowing.
4. User1 requests 1 month's loan.
5. A lender accepts this loan, the id of this loan will be the same as the one before.
6. User1 repay the old loan but in reality, the new loan is the one being paid. 

Second Scenario:
If this contract is used in a protocol, the use of the same id will lead to some issues for these protocols, like deleting the loan(paying) by some users outside the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Add a new parameter `finished` to the loan struct to make it true when the loan is repaid and don't delete it.
