# Msg.sender cannot make more then 1 cooler with the same colleteral and debt tokens.

## Summary
An address cannot use the same colleteral + debt tokencombination  twice.

## Vulnerability Detail
Its not a vulnerability. Just an inconvinience for the user.


## Impact
If a user wishes to use the same colleteral + debt pair again, he will not be able too. This is inconvinient, since the user might get new colleteral, and wants more of the same debt token again.

## Code Snippet
         //If already in existance, the following creation of cooler will fail.
        cooler = coolerFor[msg.sender][collateral][debt];

        // Otherwise generate new cooler
        if (cooler == address(0)) {...

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow the user to make multiple coolers with the same colleteral-debt pair. Could instead add one dimension to the storage array to store the multiple coolers.
