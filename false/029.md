# Issue when calculating collateralFor

## Summary

Mathematical calculation error in collateralFor()

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract assumes the initial collateral is decimal adjust i.e multiplied by 1e18 when deposting but in the collateralFor() function the amount is again multiplied by the decimals. If the contract didn't assume the initial collateral deposited is decimal adjusted then that would result in mathematical calculation error in the InterestFor() function

## Impact

Impacts the calculation of collateral required by the lender

## Tool used

Manual Review and remix and testing

## Recommendation

Either assume that the deposit will be always decimal adjust(i.e multiplied by 1e18) and remove multipying by "decimals" in collateralFor() function or multiply by the "decimal" in interestFor() function too.
