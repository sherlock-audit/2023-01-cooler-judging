# consider Cooler::Clear and Request functions which are not so safe from reentrancy

## Summary
The request() and clear() functions against reentrancy attacks without locking the previous contract on the factory.newEvent() call are performed

## Vulnerability Detail
external calls made sequentially without locking the previous contract. First, a `factory.newEvent()` call is made, which can cause other contracts associated with CoolerFactory to call back to cooller Then, a requests.push() call is made, which can add a new entry to the requests array.

If another contract linked to CoolerFactory exploits reentrancy by calling back to cooler before the requests.push() call is made, then it may change the state of the contract before a new entry is added to the requests array, thus making the contract unstable and resulting in a broken contract. .

## Impact
call factory.newEvent which can cause other contracts associated with CoolerFactory to call back to cooler. Then, a loans.push() call is made, which can add a new entry to the loans array.
``` solidity
contracts\Cooler.sol
165:         factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Clear);
166: 
167:         if (!req.active) 
168:             revert Deactivated();
169:         else req.active = false;
170: 
```
``` solidity
contracts\Cooler.sol
80:         reqID = requests.length;
81:         factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
82:         requests.push(
83:             Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
84:         );
```
## Code Snippet
``` solidity
contracts\Cooler.sol
162:     function clear (uint256 reqID) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
163:         Request storage req = requests[reqID];
164: 
165:         factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Clear);
166: 
167:         if (!req.active) 
168:             revert Deactivated();
169:         else req.active = false;
170: 
171:         uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
172:         uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral);
173:         uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;
174: 
175:         loanID = loans.length;
176:         loans.push(
177:             Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
178:         );
179:         debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);
180:     }

```

``` solidity 
contracts\Cooler.sol
74:     function request (
75:         uint256 amount,
76:         uint256 interest,
77:         uint256 loanToCollateral,
78:         uint256 duration
79:     ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
80:         reqID = requests.length;
81:         factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
82:         requests.push(
83:             Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
84:         );
85:         collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
86:     }
```
``` solidity
contracts\Factory.sol
42:     function newEvent (uint256 id, Events ev) external {
43:         require (created[msg.sender], "Only Created");
44: 
45:         if (ev == Events.Clear) emit Clear(msg.sender, id);
46:         else if (ev == Events.Rescind) emit Rescind(msg.sender, id);  
47:         else if (ev == Events.Request)
48:             emit Request(
49:                 msg.sender, 
50:                 address(Cooler(msg.sender).collateral()), 
51:                 address(Cooler(msg.sender).debt()), 
52:                 id
53:             );
54:     }
