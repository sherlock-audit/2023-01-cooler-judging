# User can clear a loan request for more tokens than they actually have

## Summary
In `ClearingHouse.sol` contract,  `clear()` funcion does not check if the amount of the loan request is greater than the available balance of the dai token before approving the transfer of amount tokens to the cooler contract. This could lead to an attacker being able to clear a loan request for more tokens, which would result in an over-issuance of tokens.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/aux/ClearingHouse.sol#L7

## Impact
```solidity
function clear (Cooler cooler, uint256 id) external returns (uint256) {
        if (msg.sender != operator) 
            revert OnlyApproved();

        // Validate escrow
        if (!factory.created(address(cooler))) 
            revert OnlyFromFactory();
        if (cooler.collateral() != gOHM || cooler.debt() != dai)
            revert BadEscrow();

        (
            uint256 amount, 
            uint256 interest, 
            uint256 ltc, 
            uint256 duration,
        ) = cooler.requests(id);

        // Validate terms
        if (interest < minimumInterest) 
            revert InterestMinimum();
        if (ltc > maxLTC) 
            revert LTCMaximum();
        if (duration > maxDuration) 
            revert DurationMaximum();

        // Clear loan
        dai.approve(address(cooler), amount);
        return cooler.clear(id);
    }
```
