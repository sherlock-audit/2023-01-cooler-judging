# Users can lose their deposited collaterals

## Summary
Borrowers can lose their deposited collaterals when they request a loan;

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Note: we assume that everybody can request a loan. Otherwise, the protocol will allow only a certain number of users to request loans;

Let's say user A creates a Cooler with Eth/USDT; User A is the owner of the created Cooler smart contract;

User B requests a loan by calling the "request" function => user B transfers collateral to the Cooler smart contract;

Now, user B's funds are locked in the smart contract and can be stolen by User A by calling the rescind function - which transfers the collateral back to the owner of the smart contract (User A), not back to User B;

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Store the address of the user that made the request in the "Request" struct and allow the user to cancel the request at any time if a loan was not executed.
