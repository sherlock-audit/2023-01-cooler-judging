# Rescind allows for borrower's funds to be unfairly claimed

## Summary
Potential for nefarious cooler owner to steal funds from potential borrowers. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `rescind()` call is restricted to owner access only. The cooler's owner, which can be anyone as the CoolerFactory contract does not place restrictions on the `generate (ERC20 collateral, ERC20 debt)` call, can operate a cooler with no upfront cost. A potential borrower may `request` a loan, at which time they must provide the collateral. The owner can then rescind the request and in turn receives the collateral. 

## Impact
Anyone can create a cooler and wait for someone to "hit" on it by requesting a loan, then run away with funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The request struct can have an additional parameter dictating the person making the request. This is also the address that is restricted to clawing back the funds. 

A simpler solution would be to restrict the access of the factory. That said, the owner still needs to do an extra step of sending the funds to the correct address.

```solidity
struct Request { // A loan begins with a borrow request. It specifies:
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 interest;
        uint256 loanToCollateral;
        uint256 duration;
        address borrower; // NEW
        bool active;
    } 
```

```solidity
function request (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interest,
        uint256 loanToCollateral,
        uint256 duration
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
        requests.push(
            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, msg.sender, true)
        );
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
    }

function rescind (uint256 reqID) external {
        Request storage req = requests[reqID];

        if (msg.sender != req.borrower) 
            revert OnlyApproved(); // Change me to a new error code if need be

        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Rescind);

        if (!req.active)
            revert Deactivated();
        
        req.active = false;
        collateral.transfer(req.borrower, collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
    }
```
