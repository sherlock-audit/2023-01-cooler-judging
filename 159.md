# Operator or Overseer cannot call defund in ClearingHouse.sol

## Summary

Operator or Overseer cannot call defund in ClearingHouse.sol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol states: The contract can be defunded by the Operator or Overseer. This function sends funds back to the treasury. First, it checks to ensure the caller is one of these addresses, then sends the passed in token with given amount to the treasury.

If msg.sender is operator or overseer, then execute defund(). However, in current iteration, because of the && sign, msg.sender must be both operator and overseer, instead of operator or overseer.

```solidity
    function defund (ERC20 token, uint256 amount) external {
        if (msg.sender != operator && msg.sender != overseer) 
```

## Impact

No one can call defund.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change && to ||. (and to or) so that either operator or overseer can call defund()

```solidity
    function defund (ERC20 token, uint256 amount) external {
-        if (msg.sender != operator && msg.sender != overseer) 
+        if (msg.sender != operator || msg.sender != overseer) 
```
