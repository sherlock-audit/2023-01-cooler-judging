# If a pair contains a non-revert-on-transfer ERC20 token, both tokens can be completely drained by the owner

## Summary

The Cooler contract uses unsafe ERC20 transfer operations, which opens an attack vector that allows draining both tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are ERC20 tokens that do not revert on failed transfers, but will just silently succeed without transferring anything. As a result, transfers for such tokens will result in wrong accounting. An example of such is the ZRX token: https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L64

This will become an attack vector: A malicious owner can create a loan without actually handing the contract any tokens. This creates an opening that allows them to steal all funds within the pair (even the other token). This is an instance of a **honeypot** attack.

**Proof of concept**: Consider the following two scenarios. Let the bad token be token X

### If the token X is collateral

1. Alice makes a loan request, with the token X as collateral. **She intentionally makes the transfer fail but not revert.**
2.1. Alice cancels her own loan request. She is "returned" the collateral. **Alice has stolen token X**.
2.2. Alice makes the debt. She never had to spent any collateral to begin with. **Alice has stolen the other token as well**.

### If the token X is debt

1. Bob makes a loan request to borrow token X. He deposits some collateral. **This deposit succeeds.**
2. Alice lends Bob token X. This is a ruse, she intentionally makes the transfer fail, but the order is cleared anyway. **Bob's collateral is now stuck in the contract, he did not receive any debt, and Alice will steal the tokens when Bob unavoidably defaults.**

It is worth noting that token X can be stolen as well, using the same method as if token X is collateral (tricking outgoing transfers to succeed).

## Impact

If one of the tokens is a non-revert on transfer, all of the funds within the pool can be drained, including the other token too.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library, which correctly handles unusual behavior ERC20 tokens, and certainly reverts on failed transfers.
