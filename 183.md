# OlympusTreasury version 3 lacks a manage function

## Summary
While version 1 and 2 of the Olympus protocol both have a `manage(address, uint256)` function, version 3 of `OlympusTreasury` contract lacks this function, so the `ClearingHouse` contract will not be compatible with the new version of the Olympus protocol and won't be able to pull funding from the treasury.


## Vulnerability Detail
`ClearingHouse` contract is supposed to interact with the OlympusTreasury contract by pulling funds via the `manage` function. Both version 1 and 2 of the Olympus protocol have this function:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x31f8cc382c9898b273eff4e0b7626a6987c846e8
https://etherscan.io/address/0x9A315BdF513367C0377FB36545857d12e85813Ef

But version 3, which is yet to be pushed to production, does not have this function:
https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/master/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol

So the `ClearingHouse` contract, if configured with version 3 of the treasury, will not be able to fund itself throgh the `fund` function:
```solidity
function fund (uint256 amount) external {
	if (msg.sender != overseer) 
		revert OnlyApproved();
	ITreasury(treasury).manage(address(dai), amount);
}
```

Because calls to this function will revert because there is no `manage` function. And without funding, the contract is unable to lend funds through the cooler.
The contract should handle that, if using version 3, the `fund` function should make the call to `withdrawReserves` instead of `manage`:
```solidity
function withdrawReserves(
	address to_,
	ERC20 token_,
	uint256 amount_
) public override permissioned onlyWhileActive {
	withdrawApproval[msg.sender][token_] -= amount_;

	token_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_);

	emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, to_, token_, amount_);
}
```


## Impact
Medium impact.

## Tool used
Manual review.


## Recommendation
Use a try-catch block inside the `fund` function to call the `VERSION` function of the treasury, which does not exist in version 1 and 2. So if the call succeeds, call the `withdrawReserves` function, and in the catch (call does not succeed), call the `manage` function.
