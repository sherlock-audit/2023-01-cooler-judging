# Lender cannot claim the interest, if the loan is defaulted

## Summary

When a request is created by a user, the cooler contract doesnt take the interest along with the collateral from the user. But this is fine, as the repay function [includes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L114) `interest` in its calculation. But if the loan is defaulted, only the [collateral initially taken from the borrower is sent to the lender](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L205). The `interest` on it is ignored, thus causing fund loss to lender.

## Vulnerability Detail

Look at the following code segments from [cooler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol) contract along with comments:
```solidity
// Borrower requesting a loan. using `request` function.
Note that collateral taken from borrower is calculated based only on the borrowed amount and loanToCollateral ratio.

collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));

//A lender clears the request, by sending request amount to the borrower.

debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);

// The borrower fails to repay the loan. So the loan gets defaulted. The lender calls the `defaulted` function to get the deposited collateral and his interest.
//But as you can see only the collateral is sent to lender. No interest is done here.
collateral.transfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);

//Note that the repay function implement this correctly, by using the below formula:
uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
```

## Impact

Lender losses the interest on the loan he is owed, if the loan is defaulted.

#### Scenario where this can be exploited: 

A borrower can attract lenders by requesting a loan with very low collateral ratio and high interest rate for a small duration. The intention of the borrower would be to default on the loan right from the beginning, as irrespective of the interest rate, he wouldn't need to pay it, if he just defaults on the loan.  

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function defaulted (uint256 loanID) external returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID];
        delete loans[loanID];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) 
            revert NoDefault();

        collateral.transfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
        return loan.collateral;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation

When the loan is requested, the borrower should transfer the interest along with the collateral.
