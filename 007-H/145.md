# `debt` tokens are sent to `address(0)` instead of lender in `repay()`

## Summary
If `repay()` is called with `repaid` = `loan.amount`, then no tokens are paid back to the lender. Instead they are burned.

## Vulnerability Detail
- `repay()` is called with `repaid` = `loan.amount`
- `loan` is deleted https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L116 Note that this sets `loan.lender = 0`
- when transfering the debt, `loan.lender` = `address(0)` so the amount repaid is sent to the zero address instead of the lender.

## Impact
Permanent loss of loan. Lender is never repaid the lent amount.

```solidity
    function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
+       address lender = loan.lender;

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();
        
        uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
        else {
            loan.amount -= repaid;
            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
        }

-       debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
+       debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
    }

```
