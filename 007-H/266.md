# It is impossible to repay the full debt amount, causing loss of funds to both borrower and lender

## Summary

The Borrower is supposed to call the [repay](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L108) function from `Cooler.sol` to repay the debt and thus getting back his collateral. But if the borrower tries to repay the whole amount, the transaction will revert as explained below.

## Vulnerability Detail

The mistake lies in the following line in repay function:
```solidity
if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
```

When the repaid amount is equal to the amount borrowed, the `loan` information is deleted from storage. Which means the `loan.lender` from the below statement is address(0) and results in a revert.

```solidity
debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
```

## Impact

This means the borrower will never be able to repay the full amount. Which causes loss of funds to both himself and lender.

## Code Snippet

The original test case tested with repay amount of half of borrowed value. But the following test case will result in a revert.

```solidity
    function test_repay() public {
        setUp();
        uint loanID = clear(request());

        // Test repay
        (,uint loan0,,,,) = cooler.loans(loanID);

        repay(0); // Repay nothing
        (,uint loan1,,,,) = cooler.loans(loanID);
        assertTrue(loan0 == loan1); // Nothing should have happened

        repay(100); // change here
        (,uint loan2,,,,) = cooler.loans(loanID);
        assertTrue(loan1 == loan2 * 2);
    }
```

Error is:

`[FAIL. Reason: ERC20: transfer to the zero address]`


## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry, VSCode

## Recommendation

Cache the `loan.lender` into memory before deleting it from storage.

```solidity
address lender = loan.lender;
```
