# Wrong assumption, not all tokens have 18 decimals

## Summary
Based on this line [Cooler.sol/#L54](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol/#L54) it seems that the protocol is expecting that all debt&collateral tokens have 18 decimals, this is a wrong assumption.

## Vulnerability Detail
Not all tokens have 18 decimals, for example USDC have only six, this means that it will be dividing the amount by 18 but it should be only divided by 6.

## Impact
This wrong assumption translate in a bad output on functions `collateralFor` and `interestFor`, so the interestFor a loan and the collateralFor will give wrong amounts.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol/#L54
```solidity
    uint256 private constant decimals = 1e18;
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol/#L245-L248
```solidity
    function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
        return amount * interest / decimals;
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol/#L236-L238
```solidity
    function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think there are two solutions for this, if you want to only allow tokens with 18 decimals you could add a require in the constructor to safely assume that the tokens has 18 decimals;
```diff
diff --git a/src/Cooler.sol b/src/Cooler.sol
index 92158d3..01b8707 100644
--- a/src/Cooler.sol
+++ b/src/Cooler.sol
@@ -56,6 +56,8 @@ contract Cooler {
     // Initialization
 
     constructor (address o, ERC20 c, ERC20 d) {
+        require(c.decimals() == 18, "Collateral must have 18 decimals");
+        require(d.decimals() == 18, "Debt must have 18 decimals");
         owner = o;
         collateral = c;
         debt = d;
```

Or well you could do extra math and based on decimals on debt token and collateral token. Save as an immutable the decimals of token `c` and decimals of token `d` and on functions `collateralFor` and `interestFor` use it to do a correct math calculation.
