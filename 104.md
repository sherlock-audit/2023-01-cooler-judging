# An `operator` can also be the `overseer` breaking access control measures

## Summary

An operator can also be the overseer which goes against the protocol's access control measures.

## Vulnerability Detail

There should be restriction at code level preventing an `operator` being the `overseer`. Currently, the `push` and `pull` functions make it possible for the same address to be set as both an `overseer` and `operator`.  The flow would be:

- Current `overseer` calls the `push` function and sets `address(a)`as a `pendingOverseer`.
- `address(a)` calls the `pull` function and becomes the new `overseer`.
- Current `operator` calls the `push` function and sets `address(a)`as a `pendingOperator`.
- `address(a)` calls the `pull` function and becomes the new `operator` at which point address(a) becomes both the `operator` and the `overseer`.

Whereas, offcain measures may be implemented, it should also be enforced at the contract level.

## Impact

Breaking access control measures e.g, `ClearingHouse::fund()` function shouldn't only be called by the `overseer`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the `pull` function, change `if (msg.sender == pendingOverseer)` to `if (msg.sender == pendingOverseer && msg.sender != operator)` 

and 

`else if (msg.sender == pendingOperator)` to `else if (msg.sender == pendingOperator) && msg.sender != overseer`
