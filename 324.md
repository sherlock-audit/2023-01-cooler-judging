# Borrowers can abuse lenders and steal debt tokens.



## Summary
Borrowers can abuse lenders and steal debt tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see [here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#no-revert-on-failure), some tokens don't revert on transfer failure but return false.

The main reason for this issue is that the current system uses `transfer()/transferfrom()` instead of `safetransfer()/safetranferfrom()` and the below scenario would be possible.

1. The borrower creates a request for `collateral = ZRX, debt = weth, interest = 100% for 1 year`
2. When the borrower sends `ZRX` to the contract, he doesn't send anything but it will work without reverting.
```solidity
    function request (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interest,
        uint256 loanToCollateral,
        uint256 duration
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
        requests.push(
            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
        );
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral)); //@audit no reverting
    }
```
3. Because of high interest, a lender might clear the request.
4. The borrower doesn't repay at all and the lender can't get anything by defaulting loan because the escrow contract doesn't have `ZRX` at all.

## Impact
Borrowers can steal debt tokens from lenders using weird collateral tokens.
