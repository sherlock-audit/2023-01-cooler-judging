# Loan rollover with only expiry change will fail

## Summary
If the collateral does not accept 0 value transfer then rolling of loan with only expiry change will always fail

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume loan id 1 need to be roll over with an extended duration of 1 month
2. roll function is called which increments the `loan.expiry`

```solidity
 loan.expiry += req.duration;
```

3. Since there is no change in collateral, newCollateral becomes 0

```solidity
uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
```

4. Finally it tries to transfer collateral which is 0 in this case. Some tokens fail when 0 amount is being transferred causing a DOS

## Impact
Loan rolling will always fail
