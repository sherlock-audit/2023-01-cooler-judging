# Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Summary
Some implementations of ERC20 standard don't revert on failures. One must check the bool return value of transfer/transferFrom function to make sure token transfer actually happened. Otherwise, loss of funds is possible.

## Vulnerability Detail
It's currently dangerous to use certain ERC20 tokens in the protocol. In particular, tokens that don't revert on failures but return a boolean value from transfer/transferFrom functions. Let's say collateral is a token that doesn't revert on failures. When borrower creates a request and the following line executes:
```solidity
collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
```
it might be that the tokens aren't actually transferred to the contract.

The lender then clears the request and transfers debt tokens to the borrower. But there is no collateral in the contract to repay the lender in case of a default.

## Impact
Marking as high instead of usual medium. This protocol is fully permissionless, there is no whitelist, therefore it's important to support as many tokens as possible.

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 library for token transfers. This way, the transaction will revert if transfer/transferFrom return false
