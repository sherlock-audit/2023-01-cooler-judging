# The Request[] struct in Cooler.sol grows indefinitely, which may result in DoS

## Summary

Every open loan is stored in an array of Reqeust[]. When the array gets too large, no one can open any more loans which results in DoS of whole protocol

## Vulnerability Detail

The function request() in Cooler.sol pushes a request struct into the Request array. The protocol then users the reqID to pinpoint the exact request. 

    function request (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interest,
        uint256 loanToCollateral,
        uint256 duration
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
        requests.push(
            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
        );

In Line 82, the Request struct is pushed into the Request array. However, during rescind() or repay(), the Request struct is not deleted in the Request array. This means that as more users use the protocol, there will be more Requests struct being pushed into the request array. Since there is no array limit, there will be a point in time where the request struct will be 'full'.

In [this documentation](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/04/06/memory-creation-overflow-bug/), the array size is 2 ** 64 -1, 1.8466e19 or 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. Even if the array size is extremely large, an attacker can DoS the protocol by sending 1 wei of collateral amount just to increase the array size. The attack can be cheaper especially if the collateral token has more than 24 decimals (eg YAM-V2) because there is no need to even deposit 1 YAM-V2 token to break the USDC-YAM-V2 pair, if the pair ever exist. 

Even if the problem is almost impossible / attacker do not have incentive to attack, still setting as medium risk because if many people use the protocol, the array of famous collateral pairs will eventually reach its maximum size. Also, recommendations make the problem pretty easy to fix.

## Impact

Lack of upper bound in Request[] may lead to DoS of collateral pair. No one can use the collateral pair anymore

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the request struct once the open loan is rescind or when the loan is repayed. Also, possibly limit the number of open loans a user can request at any given time. Also can add a minimum limit when calling request() to prevent 1 wei attacks.
