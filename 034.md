# Roll is not taking new loan terms

## Summary
On rolling the new loan terms are not taken and it is trying to duplicate the old loan terms only

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume rolling is enabled for loanId 1 using the `toggleRoll` function.

```solidity
function toggleRoll(uint256 loanID) external returns (bool) {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

        if (msg.sender != loan.lender)
            revert OnlyApproved();

        loan.rollable = !loan.rollable;
        return loan.rollable;
    }
```

2. Borrower/lender now try to roll over the loan by calling the `roll` function for loan id 1

```solidity
loan id = 1
loan amount = 100
loan duration = 1 month
loan collateral = 100
```

4. The roll function calculates the new params

```solidity
function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
        Request memory req = loan.request;
...
 uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);

        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.expiry += req.duration;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
...
}
```

5. Now `collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral)` will always return `loan.collateral` so `newCollateral` always remain 0

6. Observe the newDebt is calculated for same loan amount, interest and duration as original. No way to change this. So the amount get incremented by the interest amount
7. As we can see all loan parameters are taken from original request and there is no possibility to change loan duration/amount etc

## Impact
Rolling should allow user to customize rollover loan terms

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Pass a new request param in `roll` function which describes the new loan terms
