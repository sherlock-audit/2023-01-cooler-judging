# Collateral Can Get Stuck in rescind

## Summary

There is an unchecked `transfer` ([L102](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L102)) in the `rescind` function in [Cooler.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol) that can result in locked funds for some ERC20s. Not all ERC20s revert on failure of their `transferFrom` function. For example, [STASIS EURO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdB25f211AB05b1c97D595516F45794528a807ad8#code) returns `false` if an address is blocked. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is an example path. A user requests a loan with STATIS EURO as collateral. At the time of `request` the user is not blocked in the `transferFrom` function. The user gets blocked and when they go to `rescind` their request will get deactivated resulting in them not being able to call it in the future. The `transfer` function will return `false` and not revert. User funds were not returned and the request is locked.

## Impact

If a user uses an ERC20 as collateral that does not return `false` from `transferFrom` at the time of `request` but returns `false` at the time of `rescind` funds can get stuck.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
90:    function rescind (uint256 reqID) external {
91:        if (msg.sender != owner) 
92:            revert OnlyApproved();
93:
94:        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Rescind);
95:
96:        Request storage req = requests[reqID];
97:
98:        if (!req.active)
99:            revert Deactivated();
100:        
101:       req.active = false;
102:       collateral.transfer(owner, collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
103:   }
```

## Recommendation

Check the return value of `transfer`.
