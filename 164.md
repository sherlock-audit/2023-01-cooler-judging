# Check for address(0) in the `Cooler::delegate call`

## Summary

`Cooler::delegate call` takes an address as an input but doesn't validate the address.

## Vulnerability Detail

When an address is to be provided as an input to an important function, a check to check for `address(0)` needs to be done.
This is to prevent errors of input that would affect protocol functionality.

```solidity
    function delegate (address to) external {
        if (msg.sender != owner) 
            revert OnlyApproved();
        IDelegateERC20(address(collateral)).delegate(to);
    }  
```

## Impact

A user could wrongfully delegate to `address(0)`
