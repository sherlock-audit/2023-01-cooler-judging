# Collateral token pauses may cause avoidable defaults

## Summary

Collateral token pauses may cause avoidable defaults


## Vulnerability Detail

Part of loan repayment involves the automatic sending of proportional collateral to the loan owner. If this collateral token is paused, any transaction trying to move the collateral will revert.


## Impact

If the collateral token is paused, the transaction attempting to repay the loan will revert, and eventually the loan will default. Later, once the token is unpaused, the lender will get to take the defaulted collateral, even though the user tried to make the payment.


## Code Snippet

Repaying the loan forces the caller to make two transfers, rather than just repaying the loan:
```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.repay()   #1

122            debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
123:@>         collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Separate the sending of the collateral into a separate function that the `Cooler` owner can call in a pull-model.
