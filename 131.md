# Missing Max and Min Checks when creating a Request

## Summary
`request()` has nearly no checks in regards to the inputs allowed. There ought to be some sanity checks and reasonable limits put in place. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Without the sanity checks people can create request that either make no sense "requesting 0 amount" or are disadvantageous to themselves or the lender. 
## Impact
Users can create request that don't fit the parameters set in the protocols documentation.
Users can create never ending loans and have no intention of paying it back: no check on duration
Users can create junk request
