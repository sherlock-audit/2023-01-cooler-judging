# An attacker can block the contract and cause a dos to users with usdc

## Summary
An attacker can block the contract and cause dos to users with usdc
## Vulnerability Detail
If debt is usdc 
and collateral is another blocklisting token 
An attacker can send 1 wei and that will blocklist the lender and this contract   and it will cause the borrower not to be able to repay the loan and the lender not be able to get back their collateral
## Impact
 A malicious user can cause funds to be stuck in the contract And loans  will not be able to be repayed
## Code Snippet
```solidity

        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
//defaulted
      collateral.transfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make a function that owner can change their address and lender 
Mostly for the owner because it's immutable and it can cause dos on the owner's address
