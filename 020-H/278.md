# A lender is able to prevent repayment of a loan if they are on the token's blocklist

## Summary

A borrower trying to repay their loan might be unable to do so if the lender is on the ```debt``` token's blocklist (eg. USDC).

## Vulnerability Detail

The ```repay``` function in ```Cooler.sol``` allows anyone to repay a loan. If the loan has not yet expired and there is an outstanding amount to be repaid, the caller sends ```debt``` tokens (eg. USDC) to the current ```lender``` address for the loan. If the lender is on the token's blocklist, the transfer fails and causes the call to the ```repay``` function to revert. The lender could then wait until the loan defaults and call the ```default``` function to retrieve the collateral tokens.

## Impact

The borrower would be unable to retrieve their collateral. Since collateral given for a loan is usually worth more than the amount borrowered (overcollateralized) the borrower could suffer a net loss. Malicious lenders could intentionally put themselves on a blocklist to profit from overcollateralized loans.

## Recommendation

Consider storing the amount of tokens owed to the lender and implement a function that would allow the lender to withdraw the tokens instead of sending to the lender in the ```repay``` function.
