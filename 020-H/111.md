# If debt token has a blacklist (like USDC / tether / ...), then repay() does not work for borrower

## Summary
`Cooler.repay` sends the debt token to the lender, if the debt token has implemented a blacklist (like USDC, Tether, ...) and the lender is added to the blacklist of that token it's not possible for the borrower to repay his debt.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the debt token is USDC and a borrower wants to repay his debt, he needs to use the repay function.

```solidity
function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

    if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
        revert Default();
    
    uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

    if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
    else {
        loan.amount -= repaid;
        loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
    }

    debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
    collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
}
```

The repay functions transfers the repaid amount directly to the lender via
`debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);`

Now if the lender was added to the backlist of USDC because of a malicious behaviour (interacting with tornado or anything) the transfer will fail and so the complete function. The borrower now has no chance to ever pay back his debt.

## Impact
If the debt token has a blacklist check for token transfers and the lender is added to that blacklist, the borrower can't repay his debt and will loose all his collateral tokens.

## Recommendation
Instead of sending tokens directly to the lender, consider storing it in a variable where the lender can withdraw it via a withdraw function.
