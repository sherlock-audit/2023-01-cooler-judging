# Blocklisted addresses can be used to trigger defaults

## Summary

Lenders can trigger defaults by temporarily transfering loans to blocklisted addresses


## Vulnerability Detail

During repayment of loans, the debt is transferred directly to the lender, rather than than to the `Cooler` for later retrieval by the lender.


## Impact

A malicious user (e.g. a member of the North Korean Lazarus Group, or a disgruntled user of Whirlpool) can transfer the loan to a blocked address that they control, preventing the borrower from being able to repay the loan since the debt can't be transferred to the blocked address. The attacker can wait until the loan is in default before transferring the loan back to a non-blocked address, and claim the collateral. 

They can scan the blockchain for any new loan requests and can do this to any user that is asking for loans in a token that they are blocklisted on, any number of times. Any token with a blocklist will essentially become unsafe to interact with.

 
## Code Snippet

Repayment requires that the funds be sent to the current lender's address:
```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.   #1

108        function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
109            Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
...
122 @>         debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
123            collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
124:       }
```

The lender can change that address at any time using the [`approve()` and `transfer()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L209-L229) functions, then once the loan is in default, change it back.


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
Change from a push model to a pull model, where the `Cooler` custodies the debt payments until they're claimed by the lender in a separate call that they make
