# Attackers can force borrower unable to repay the loan in case debt token is USDC

## Summary
Function `Cooler.repay()` will transfer debtToken directly from the sender to the lender. It will create some risk when lender finds a way to block the transfer to him(her).
 
## Vulnerability Detail
[USDC](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa2327a938febf5fec13bacfb16ae10ecbc4cbdcf#code) is one of the popular stable coins which was widely used by many people. There is a list (mapping) in USDC called `blacklist` which block every transactions (transfer, mint) that contain at least 1 address belong to this list. 
A malicious user who has at least 1 blacklisted wallet can execute this strategy to block user repaying the loan. At first I assume the debt token we are using here is USDC. 
1. Attacker call `Cooler.clear()` with a non-blacklisted address (he can easily create a new one by using metamask) to fill a requested loan.  
2. Attacker transfer the `lender` role to `blacklisted` address by calling `Cooler.approve()` then `Cooler.transfer()`. 
==> Now the current lender of loan is `blacklisted` address
3. When borrower try to call `Cooler.roll()` to repay the debt, the transaction will be reverted because the loan.lender is USDC's blacklisted address. 

## Impact
Attacker can force user unable to repay the loan to get the collateral.

## Tool used
Manual review 

## Recommendation
Create one more mapping to store amount repayed by the borrower then create one function for lender to call to claim the fund. 
```solidity=
mapping(address => uint) repayedAmount;

function claimRepayedAmount() external {
    debt.safeTransfer(msg.sender, repayedAmount);
    repayedAmount[msg.sender] = 0;
}
```
