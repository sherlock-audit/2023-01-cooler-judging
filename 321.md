# A deleted loan can be transferred later.



## Summary
A deleted loan can be transferred later.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a logic to change the lender of the loan like below.

```solidity
    function approve (address to, uint256 loanID) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID];

        if (msg.sender != loan.lender)
            revert OnlyApproved();

        approvals[loanID] = to;
    }

    /// @notice execute approved transfer of loan ownership
    /// @param loanID index of loan in loans[]
    function transfer (uint256 loanID) external {
        if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID])
            revert OnlyApproved();

        approvals[loanID] = address(0);
        loans[loanID].lender = msg.sender;
    }
```

But it doesn't reset the `approvals` when the loan is deleted after repaid fully or defaulted.

As a result, the deleted loans can be transferred again and they can have a new lender.

## Impact
There is no direct fund loss but it's not recommended to transfer deleted loans.

## Recommendation
We can modify `transfer()` like below.

```solidity
    function transfer (uint256 loanID) external {
        if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID])
            revert OnlyApproved();

        if(loans[loanID].lender == address(0)) //++++++++++++++++++++
            revert Deactivated(); //deleted

        approvals[loanID] = address(0);
        loans[loanID].lender = msg.sender;
    }
```
