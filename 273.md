# Hardcoded values in ClearingHouse can lead to a bad state

## Summary
Hardcoded values in ClearingHouse prevent adjustments to changing market conditions and bring contract in a bad state.

## Vulnerability Detail
`ClearingHouse.clear` is using constant values to decide if it should accept a lona request from a Cooler or not.

```solidity
File: src/aux/ClearingHouse.sol
33:     uint256 public constant minimumInterest = 2e16; // 2%
34:     uint256 public constant maxLTC = 2_500 * 1e18; // 2,500
35:     uint256 public constant maxDuration = 365 days; // 1 year
```

If market conditions change, it's not possible to adapt to make it more defensive or aggresive depending on the current market.

This will require a re-deployment of a new ClearingHouse and changing the values in the source-code before deployment, what can lead to errors and missconfigurations.

## Impact
If market conditions change and the protocol want to accept interesets != 2% or more or less LTC it's not possible and require a redeployment and changing the source-code.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using state variables and implement functions to update the values. With this, you can react and adapt the conditions depending on the current market.
If it is required that the values stay fixed, use immutable variables and set them in the constructor in the deployment, so you don't need to change the source code.
