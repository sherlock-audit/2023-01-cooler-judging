# Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Vulnerability Detail
It is good to add a `require()` statement that checks the return value of token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelinâ€™s `safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom` unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

Reference this similar medium-severity finding from Consensys Diligence Audit of Fei Protocol: https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/01/fei-protocol/#unchecked-return-value-for-iweth-transfer-call

## Impact
Silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function request (
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 interest,
    uint256 loanToCollateral,
    uint256 duration
) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
    reqID = requests.length;
    factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
    requests.push(
        Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
    );
    // @audit use safeTransfer instead
    collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom or require() consistently.
