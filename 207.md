# Rollable loans can be indefinitely rolled, opening up room for a griefing attack that will permanently lock funds.

## Summary

If a loan is rollable, and if a malicious borrower has enough collateral, they can perform a griefing attack that creates a lesser-known type of bad debt for the lender: A debt that is technically not defaulted, but extends indefinitely.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let us first note that rolling a loan **does not turn off rolling capability**. It also has no access control: Anyone can call this (however at the cost of their own funds).

Therefore, assuming an attacker has enough collateral, they can roll a cleared loan to an effectively infinite timestamp. The consequence is that, if the borrower defaults, **the collateral is effectively locked within the contract**, as the contract logic will not recognize a default for effectively an eternity, since the lender cannot resolve the defaulted loan.

Since loans are rollable by default, there is no way to prevent someone from clearing a loan as soon as it appears, and spam the griefing attack.

It is worth noting that, under special ERC20 tokens that don't revert on failed transfer, **the attack can be done for free**.

## Impact

It is possible to lock collateral tokens indefinitely using rollable loans mechanism, as long as the collateral condition can be cleared (which has been shown to be possible).

## Recommendation

Make rolling false by default, and turn off rolling capability after each successful roll.

Additionally, we recommend adding a sanity check to the loan duration, to prevent accidental lengthy loans.
