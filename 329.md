# Not using  OpenZepplin contracts

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The Cooler project chooses to either reimplement or copy contracts codes , rather than consistently importing them from OpenZepplin and modifying them. 

## Impact

This increases the amount of code that the team will have to maintain and misses all the improvements and bug fixes that the OpenZeppelin team is constantly implementing. 

## Code Snippet

The ERC20 contract can be replaced with OpenZepplin's ERC20 contract
