# transferFrom can transfer different amount than calculated from collateralFor function

## Summary

TOKENS LIKE ```STA``` TAKE FEES ON TRANSFER AND COULD LEAD TO INCORRECT CALCULATION in ```collateralFor```

## Vulnerability Detail

[STA](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa7DE087329BFcda5639247F96140f9DAbe3DeED1#code) Token for example cuts fee on every ```transferFrom``` call and doesn't transfer the exact amount of tokens.

As proof there is example with [STA](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa7DE087329BFcda5639247F96140f9DAbe3DeED1#code) token.

## Recommendation

Make sure that exactly same amount is sent to the contract:

```solidity
function request (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interest,
        uint256 loanToCollateral,
        uint256 duration
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
        requests.push(
            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
        );
        uint256 balanceBefore = collateral.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 amountToSend = collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral);

        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountToSend);

        uint256 balanceAfter = collateral.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(balanceAfter - balanceBefore == amountToSend);
    }
```
