# Rounding issues will affect the repayment of loans

## Summary

Solidity rounds down by default. The `repay()` function will therefore have cases where the decollateralized amount is lower. if multiple repayments are being done, these could add up to a significant amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

The calculation of the `decollateralized` amount returned to the `owner` is calculated as:

```solidity
uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
```

Due to solidity rounding down by default, there will be cases where the `decollateralized` is rounded down. Also note that this value is what is returned to the `owner`.

```solidity
collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
```

By the time full repayment is done, the `owner` is likely to receive less than the collateral they deposited. For some high value tokens, even the loss of one token could be a major loss.

It should also be noted, that there is no function to return any collateral that was affected by the rounding back to the `owner`.

## Impact

The loan owner will lose funds.

## Recommendation

If a loan is fully repaid, any collateral balance that may still be in the contract due to rounding down should be transfered to the loan owner.
