# Token with decimals less than 18 might not working as expected

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L237

## Vulnerability Detail
Accounting in Cooler contract assumed that token has 18 decimals. If token have low decimals, `collateralFor()` can return zero because of rounding down.

For example, collateral has 24 decimals and debt token has 2 decimals, 
and assume `1 collateral = 100 debt token` 
* if borrower want to borrow `1000 debt token = 1e3 * 1e2 = 1e5 token wei`, 
* he will need `10 collateral token = 10 * 1e24 = 1e25 token wei`. 
* There will not exist any value for `loanToCollateral` to make this pair valid because even when `loanToCollateral = 1` (smallest possible value), the calculation will be

```solidity
amount * decimals / loanToCollateral = 1e5 * 1e18 / 1 = 1e23
```
While we need around `1e25 wei` of collateral token for `1e5 wei` of debt token.


## Impact
Pair of collateral and debt tokens with decimals difference more than 18 will not working


## Code Snippet
```solidity
function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral; // @audit not work with token decimals != 18
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using decimals of collateral token and debt token in calculation instead of fixed value 1e18
