# Collateral can be slashed during staking cause loss of funds for lender

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L151

## Vulnerability Detail
Cooler allows owner to delegate voting power to another address if collateral is a voting token has `delegate()` function. 

However, during staking and voting, collateral might be slashed because of delegated address. It means balance of collateral in Cooler will reduce and in case loan is defaulted, it will not have enough collateral to pay back lender. 

## Impact
Loss of funds for lender when collateral get slashed.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function delegate (address to) external { 
  // @audit collateral might be slashed
    if (msg.sender != owner) 
        revert OnlyApproved();
    IDelegateERC20(address(collateral)).delegate(to);
}
```
