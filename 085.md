# Protocol does not support fee on transfer tokens

## Summary

The protocol does not handle fee on transfer tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail

There are `ERC20` tokens that may make certain customizations to their `ERC20` contracts. One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()` . Others are rebasing tokens that increase in value over time.

## Impact

This will break functionality involving transfers when fee on transfer tokens are used.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the `ERC20` token does not implement any customizations.Â  Alternatively, a mitigation is to measure the asset change right before and after the asset-transferring routines
