# `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` should not be used for arbitrary tokens

## Summary
OpenZeppelin's safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom should be used instead to handle tokens that do not conform to the ERC20 standard.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens such as ZRX does not revert on failure but returns false. In our case, since return value of `transfer` and `transferFrom` call is not checked, it can be the case that a `request` can be opened even though contract does not even hold `collateral`, as Borrower can "fake" a transfer if such tokens are used as `collateral` token.

## Impact
Lender who clears a loan and transfer `debt` token to Borrower will lose their assets, as the contract does not even hold the promised collateral of Borrower.

Borrower can abuse such tokens and steal from any potential Lender. Since protocol intends to support all ERC20s, we should take precaution for these tokens.

## Recommendation
We recommend using OpenZeppelin's implementation of `safeTransferFrom` and `transferFrom` when doing transfers.
