# Risk using Blacklistable tokens

## Summary
If debt token is blacklistable and lender's account is blacklisted, borrower will be unable to return the debt and will lose the collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say debt/collateral pair is USDC/WETH. Lender can clear a loan request and then have their USDC address blacklisted. When borrower tries to repay the request it will revert because code tries to transfer repayment directly to the lender:
```solidity
debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
```
In this scenario it is not possible for the borrower to get the collateral back. Eventually, the loan will expire and the lender will be able to withdraw the collateral.

## Impact
There is a risk for a borrower to lose the collateral in case lender's address is blacklisted

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Option 1: Explicitly specify that blacklistable tokens bears this risk
Option 2: Transfer debt from the borrower to the contract first and let the lender withdraw it in a separate transaction. This way if lender address is blacklisted, the borrower will still be able to get the collateral back
