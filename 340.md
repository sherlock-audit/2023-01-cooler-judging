# Can't be repaid with higher values


## Summary

Underflow will revert

## Vulnerability Details

Code will revert on underflow as this is not checked and won't let repayments if wrongly used bigger amounts, but custom errors for tracking what happened won't be neither displayed. Optimal affair would be to enable the payment but to refund exceeded amount or to throw an error as this is intended

```solidity
//@audit underflow revert 
100 loan.amount 
repaid 101 
loan.collateral 100  
Then decollaterized 101

100 - 101 will revert

if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
else {
    loan.amount -= repaid;
    loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
}
```

## Impact

Reverts / payments not allowed but gas wasted

## Tool used

Manual analysis

## Recommendation

Check that value is not higher than amount to repay or revert with a custom error so it's known what happens
