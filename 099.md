# It's possible to create loan with 0 duration

## Summary
It's possible to create loan with 0 duration. As result owner will lose collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Cooler.reques`t allows to create new request for loan. 1 of it's params is `duration`. Currently it's not checked and it's possible to provide value of 0.
That means that once lender will call `clear`, then loan is already defaulted.

This is dangerous for borrower as he can mistakenly create such request and anyone can instantly [`clear` that request](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L173) and in 1 second [take his collateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L202) using `defaulted` function. Because collateral amount should be bigger than loan amount, owner will lose some funds.
## Impact
Loss of collateral for owner.
