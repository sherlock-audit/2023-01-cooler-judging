# BNB collateral will be locked in the contract

## Summary

BNB tokens will be locked in the `Cooler` forever if used as collateral


## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens such as BNB properly implement the ERC20 standard when it comes to the `transferFrom()` function, but when it comes to the `transfer()` function, they forgot to include a return value. Because of this, when the address is cast to ERC20, the function signature won't match and the transactions will [revert](https://twitter.com/uniswap/status/1072286773554876416?lang=en).


## Impact

Tokens like BNB will be able to be transferred in since those transfers use `transferFrom()`, but they'll be unable to be taken back out, since `transfer()` will revert.


## Code Snippet

All transfers out of collateral use `IERC20.transfer()`, where the signature won't match:

```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.rescind()   #1

102:@>         collateral.transfer(owner, collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
```

```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.repay()   #2

123 @>         collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L123

```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.defaulted()   #3

205:@>         collateral.transfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelin's `safeTransfer()`, which is able to handle the missing return value
