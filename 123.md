# Cooler.collateralFor() is calculated wrongly, resulting in extreme disproportion of collateral paid to debt owed.

## Summary

Borrower may have to pay more collateral than needed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The user in this protocol has to suggest his own LTV ratio, which is noted here as loanToCollateral here. If a user deposits $10000 USDC worth of ETH with a LTV of 20%, then he can borrow $2,000 dollars worth of USDC. 

The function collateralFor() is used to calculate how much collateral a use needs to put aside based on how much he wants to borrow.
 
```solidity
    /// @notice compute collateral needed for loan amount at given loan to collateral ratio
    /// @param amount of collateral tokens
    /// @param loanToCollateral ratio for loan
    function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
    }
```

loanToCollateral is the ratio for loan, ie 20%. 

If amount is USDC, ie user wants to borrow 1000 USDC and use a collateral of BNB, then 1000e6 * 1e18 / 20  is an extremely huge number to deposit as collateral. 

## Impact

Collateral accounting breaks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the decimals in collateralFor() since amount that is passed in is already in the decimals of the debt tokens to borrow. 

1. Find the collateral value to deposit in 'amount' first, ie have to deposit 1000 USDC worth of BNB (take BNB as collateral).
2. Adjust the decimals of the 'amount' to become 'collateral' , ie if USDC to BNB , then have to multiply by 1e12
3. Deposit Xe18 worth of BNB as collateral to borrow 1000 USDC.
