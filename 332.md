# ERC20 not checked on transfer


## Summary

ERC20 not checked on transfer in collaterals may result on transfer not being realized

## Vulnerability Detail

ERC20 implementations are not always consistent. Some implementations of `transfer` and `transferFrom` could return `false` on failure instead of reverting. It is safer to wrap such calls into `require()` statements or use safe wrapper functions implementing return value/data checks to handle these failures. For reference, see similar [Medium-severity finding](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/09/aave-protocol-v2/#unhandled-return-values-of-transfer-and-transferfrom) from Consensys Diligence Audit of Aave Protocol V2.

See similar [issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/39) previously reported in code4rena

## Impact

Code behavior working as if transfer worked. Possible loss of assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a TransferHelper library for ERC20 transfers

```diff
- IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
+ TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```
