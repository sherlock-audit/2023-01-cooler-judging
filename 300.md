# Borrower can be prevented to repay loan

## Summary

Depending on the used debt token, the lender might block the borrower from repaying the loan and receiving back (a part of) the collateral. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens support blacklisting (e.g. USDT or USDC), which could block certain addresses from both sending and receiving USDC. (In case of USDC: [https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/0d3cab14ebd133a83fc834dbd48d0468bdf0b391/contracts/v1/FiatTokenV1.sol#L272-L282](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/0d3cab14ebd133a83fc834dbd48d0468bdf0b391/contracts/v1/FiatTokenV1.sol#L272-L282))

Therefore, if a lender gets blacklisted on USDC (e.g. by interacting with Tornado Cash on purpose), the `repay()` function will revert and the borrower is unable to pay back (a part of) the loan in order to get back (a part of) the collateral.

```solidity
function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

    if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
        revert Default();
    
    uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

    if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
    else {
        loan.amount -= repaid;
        loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
    }

    debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
    collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
}
```

## Impact

Letâ€™s assume the scenario in which the price of the collateral token in relation to the debt token increased significantly and the borrower wishes to repay a part of the loan to get back some of the collateral. In case the lender is blacklisted and unable to receive the debt tokens, the borrower is unable to pay back the loan and receive back collateral. Instead, the lender will wait until the loan defaults and claim all the collateral from the borrower.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Although it will lead to additional gas costs, it is recommended in the `repay()` function to keep track of the funds to which the lender and contract owner are entitled to whenever the borrower repays the loan. An additional function can be created to subsequently withdraw the funds of either to the lender or contract owner. This way the token transfer of the collateral to the contract owner will not be impacted if the token transfer of the debt token to the lender reverts.
