# Division rounding can make fraction-price lower than intended

## Summary
In `Cooler.sol.repay()`, the decollateralized is calculated. This calculation rounds down, which can lead to situations where significantly less repay are paid out to stakers, because the effect of the rounding is multiplied by the duration. This function also do not check if the value of `repaid` is 0. If that is the case, the call will revert due to the division by zero error.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

```solidity
function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();
        
        uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
        else {
            loan.amount -= repaid;
            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
        }

        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You could accumulate the differences that occur due to rounding. Also check `repaid` is not zero, because we will get division by zero error. Consider adding a require statement in the functions to ensure `repaid` > 0.
