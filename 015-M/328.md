# `loan.amount` can be repaid without altering `loan.collateral`

## Summary

Due to round down, this would break the invariants of how assets are repaid

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's say
`loan.collateral` = 1000;
`repaid` = 1;
`loan.amount` = 10_000;

This means that:
`uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;`

What stands for:
`1000 * 1 / 10000` -> `0`

Due to round down from `/ 10_000`. Then else block is triggered:
```solidity
if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
else {
    loan.amount -= repaid;
    loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
}
```

And while `loan.amount` would be repaid `1`, `loan.collateral` would remain the same because of `decollateralized` being 0

Same issue can happen with other values of `repaid`.

```solidity
/// @notice repay a loan to recoup collateral
/// @param loanID index of loan in loans[]
/// @param repaid debt tokens to repay
function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

    if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
        revert Default();
    
    uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

    if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
    else {
        loan.amount -= repaid;
        loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
    }

    debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
    collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
}
```

## Impact

Repaying without decreasing collateral

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Don't allow loan.amount to be bigger than `loan.collateral * repaid`

```diff
+ require(loan.collateral * repaid >= loan.amount);
```
