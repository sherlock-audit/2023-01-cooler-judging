# Borrower can't roll a loan over when call `repay()` before

## Summary
Function `Cooler.roll()` is used to roll a loan over. It will calculate the new collateral that sender need to send to extend the loan. The formula to determine this value is as follow: 
```solidity=
uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
```
Which `collateralFor()` is implemented as: 
```solidity=
function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
}
```
This formula works based on the assumption that the `loan.collateral` always less than `loan.amount * decimals / loanToCollateral` because the `loan.amount` is composed by the original loan amount and the interest. But this assumption won't be always true since the function `Cooler.repay()` use the rounding down when calculating variable `decollateralized`
```solidity=
uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
else {
    loan.amount -= repaid;
    loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
}
```
Thus after some transactions calling `repay()`, users can't call the function `roll()` because the `collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) < loan.collateral;` 

## Vulnerability Detail
To explain the vulnerability I will describe it through example below:
First I assume that the interest for the loan is 0 for easy to describe. 

* User A use 100 USDC as collateral to borrow 1000 KNC from --> `loanToCollateral = 1000 / 100 = 10` 
* User A call `Cooler.repay(loanID, repaid = 19)`
    * `decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount = 100 * 19 / 1000 = 1`
    * `loan.amount = 1000 - 19 = 981`
    * `loan.collateral = 100 - 1 = 99`
* User A call `Cooler.roll(loanId)`
    * `newCollateral = collateralFor(981, 10) - 99 = 981 / 10 - 99 = 98 - 99 = -1 < 0`
==> **Revert because of underflow**

## Impact
Borrower can't roll the loan over

## Tool used
Manual review 

## Recommendation
Modify function `Cooler.roll()` as follow: 
```solidity=
function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
    Request memory req = loan.request;

    if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();
    if (!loan.rollable) revert NotRollable();
    
    /// change here 
    uint256 newCollateral;
    if (collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) < loan.collateral) {
        newCollateral = 0;
    } else {
        newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
    }
    uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);

    loan.amount += newDebt;
    loan.expiry += req.duration;
    loan.collateral += newCollateral;

    collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
}
```
