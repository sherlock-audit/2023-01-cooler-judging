# Missing check for decollateralized > 0 in Cooler.repay

## Summary
Missing check in `Cooler.repay` can bring ratio for loan.amount and loan.collateral out of sync and lead to lost of funds for borrower and stucked collateral in Cooler contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation in `Cooler.repay` calculates the `decollateralized` that will be transfered back to the borrower and repays the lender the amount.
```solidity
File: src/Cooler.sol
114:         uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
```

The problem is, that depending on the current loan.collateral and loan.amount the value can be 0 and so the loan.amount will reduce, but the loan.collateral will stay the same.

Whenever `loan.collateral * repaid < loan.amount` the borrower will pay the amount for `repaid` to the lender, but will never get back any collateral as it will always result in 0.

## Impact
If borrower uses repay but is not paying enough, he will loose collateral as he will not get back any tokens for his payment. This can also lead to unexpected behaviour for `Cooler.roll` as the ratio for loan.amount and loan.collateral is out of sync.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check for `decollateralized > 0` so it's not possible for a borrower to repay not enough tokens to break the formular.

https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L108-L124
```solidity
function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

    if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
        revert Default();
    
    uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
    
    // @audit add check here, so it's not possible to have decollateralized == 0
    require(decollateralized > 0, "not enough repaid");

    if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
    else {
        loan.amount -= repaid;
        loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
    }

    debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
    collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
}
```
