# Unchecked return values from `transfer` or `transferFrom` could lead to stealing of funds.

## Summary

In the contracts `Cooler`, the return values of ERC20 `transfer` and `transferFrom` are not checked to be true, which could be false if the transferred tokens are not ERC20-compliant (e.g., USDT).

## Vulnerability Detail

In such case, the transfer fails without being noticed by the calling contract.

## Impact

This can lead to Stealing of Funds of Lender from the Attacker.

## Proof of Concept

Following Attack vector can be leveraged by the Attacker:

1. Call `generate` with USDT as collateral and debt as any other commonly used token.
2. Call `request` method with all the details.
3. Here the `transferFrom` will fails with false as return value indicating the failure but that return value is not validated in `Cooler`.
4. Lender will clear thinking in case of default he/she will get the collateral.
5. This way attacker will get the debt tokens without giving any collateral.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: Cooler.sol

85:      collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend using the `SafeERC20` library implementation from Openzeppelin and call `safeTransfer` or `safeTransferFrom` when transferring ERC20 tokens.
