# Lenders will lend to the wrong person

## Summary
Lenders will always lend to the wrong person when they call the "clear" function;

## Vulnerability Detail
Lenders will always send the "debt" token to the owner of the Cooler;

## Impact
Note: we assume that everybody can request a loan. Otherwise, the protocol will allow only a certain number of users to request loans;

Person A deploy a new Cooler => person A is the owner of the cooler;

Person B creates a loan request using the "request" function and sends funds to the smart contract.

When Person C decides to lend to Person B by using the "clear" function, Person C will send "debt" tokens to the owner of the smart contract (Person A) => Person B deposited the collateral but did not receive the loan; Person A received the "debt" => Person A & Person C can't get their funds back;

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Store the address of Person B in the "Request" struct. When a lender calls the clear function, the funds should be sent to the owner of the request (Person B)
