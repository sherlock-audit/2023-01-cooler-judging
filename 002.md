# transferFrom return value not checked.

## Summary

Some ERC20 tokens like [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L74) does not revert on insufficient balance, instead they return false.

## Vulnerability Detail

User can generate cooler from the factory contract passing ZRX token as collateral, then when someone tries to create loan request the funciton will call the ZRX's transferFrom function to transfer tokens from msg.sender to the cooler. Since ZRX does not revert on insufficient balance and the return value is not checked, user without collateral balance will be able to create requests, which can brake functionality.
