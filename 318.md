# Cooler: the lender can liquidate the borrower by refusing to be repaid.

## Summary
When the debt token is USDC, the lender can refuse to be repaid by joining the USDC blacklist.
## Vulnerability Detail
If the user is in the USDC blacklist, the user will not be able to receive USDC.
In the repay function, when the borrower repays the loan, the debt token is sent to the lender.
```solidity
    function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();
        
        uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
        else {
            loan.amount -= repaid;
            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
        }

        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
    }
```
When the debt token is USDC, the lender can add himself to the USDC blacklist, thus preventing the borrower from repaying the loan. When the loan expires, the lender can obtain the borrower's collateral.
