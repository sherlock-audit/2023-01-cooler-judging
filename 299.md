# ClearingHouse operator might not be able to transfer his rights

## Summary

In case a user/contract is both assigned the overseer and operator role of the ClearingHouse contract, the operator role cannot be changed.

## Vulnerability Detail

If msg.sender is both overseer and operator, he can only set pendingOverseer. He has to wait until pendingOverseer pulls until he can set pendingOperator.

```solidity
function push (address newAddress) external {
    if (msg.sender == overseer) 
        pendingOverseer = newAddress;
    else if (msg.sender == operator) 
        pendingOperator = newAddress;
    else revert OnlyApproved();
}
```

## Impact

The overseer/operator user is unable to change the operator role without first changing his/her overseer role to another address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Specify in the `push()` function whether the overseer or operator address should be set:

```solidity
function push (address newAddress, bool changeOverseer) external {
    if (msg.sender == overseer && changeOverseer) 
        pendingOverseer = newAddress;
    else if (msg.sender == operator) 
        pendingOperator = newAddress;
    else revert OnlyApproved();
}
```
