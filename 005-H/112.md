## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Since anyone can call the roll function, a bad actor can roll over any and every rollable loan in existence. A bad actor can also ensure that he never pays his debt as he can roll any rollable loan forever

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be access control to restrict who can roll over a loan. For example, only the borrower of a loan can roll it over.  One way this could be done is by adding another parameter to the struct  i.e. a borrower 
```solidity 
struct Loan { // A request is converted to a loan when a lender clears it.
        Request request; // The terms of the loan are saved, along with:
        ...
        address borrower; //additional parameter
    }



```

Then in the roll function, you can have a require or custom error handling statement like this 

```solidity 
 function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
        require (msg.sender == loan.borrower, "not borrower");
       ...
       }
```
