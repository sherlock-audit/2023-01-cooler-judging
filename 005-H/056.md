# Cooler: roll function should not be callable by anyone

## Summary
The `Cooler.roll` function allows to extend the loan for another period.
When the loan is rollable, this function can be called by anyone.

One might think that this is not a problem because the collateral must be provided by the `msg.sender`.

I argue that this is a problem and the function should only be callable by the `owner` of the Cooler.

## Vulnerability Detail
Think of this scenario:
The `collateral` token might lose a lot of value compared to the `debt` token.
The lender can then call the `roll` function, providing cheap `collateral`. The borrower then needs to pay the expensive `debt`.

Even without this though, not anyone should be able to influence the duration of a borrower's loan.

## Impact
Anyone can extend loan and influence the amount that the borrower must pay back.

## Recommendation
Only the borrower (i.e. `owner) should be able to call the `Cooler.roll` function.
