# Lender / EOA Grief & Theft

## Summary

The [`roll`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L129) function in [Cooler.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol) does not check if the caller is the lender or borrower. An EOA or the lender can grief the borrower by extending the loan making them pay more interest. If the collateral ERC20 does not revert from `transferFrom` ([L146](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L146)) the cost can be zero (aside from gas). The lender can also inflate the debt making the borrower pay more interest.

## Vulnerability Detail

A user creates a loan with collateral that does not revert when `transferFrom` is called and returns `false` (EX. [STASIS EURO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdB25f211AB05b1c97D595516F45794528a807ad8#code)). At this point any address can artificially inflate the user's debt and loan length through `roll`. The function runs and does not revert even though nothing transferred from the `transferFrom` (returned `false`). State changes. For obvious reasons increasing the debt artificially can be beneficial to the lender.

## Impact

EOAs and lenders can inflate a borrower's debt.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
129:    function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
130:        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
131:        Request memory req = loan.request;
132:
133:        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
134:            revert Default();
135:
136:        if (!loan.rollable)
137:            revert NotRollable();
138:
139:        uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
140:        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
141:
142:        loan.amount += newDebt;
143:        loan.expiry += req.duration;
144:        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
145:        
146:        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
147:    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add role checks to [`roll`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L129) and check the return of `transferFrom`.
