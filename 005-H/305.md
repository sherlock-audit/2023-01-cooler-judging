# [H] Attacker can extend rollable loans by call `roll()` and force borrowers to pay higher interest

## Summary

If the value of the collateral is lower than the debt, a malicious third party repeatedly calls the `roll()` function pay the collateral for interest and force borrowers to pay more interest in `repay()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Under the current implementation, anyone can roll over a loan if `rollable` is true.

In some cases, lenders and borrowers may agree to only a partial collateral requirement on the blockchain, the value of the collateral is relatively low compared to the loan. 

In such cases, if a malicious third party repeatedly calls the `roll()` function, they can force the loan to be extended by paying only a small value of collateral, making the borrower pay more interest, even if they repay the loan early, which is detrimental to the borrower and increases the risk of default.

## Impact

Borrowers can be rolled over without their knowledge and forced to pay more interest

## Code Snippet

https://github.dev/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L129-L147
```solidity
function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
        Request memory req = loan.request;

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();

        if (!loan.rollable)
            revert NotRollable();

        uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);

        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.expiry += req.duration;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
    }
```
