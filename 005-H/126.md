# Cooler.roll() and Cooler.repay() should only be called by the debt owner

## Summary

Other borrowers can accidentally pay for a borrower's loan or execute roll accidentally.

## Vulnerability Detail

Functions roll() and repay() do not have an onlyOwner check.

```solidity
    function rescind (uint256 reqID) external {
        if (msg.sender != owner) 
            revert OnlyApproved();


        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Rescind);


        Request storage req = requests[reqID];


        if (!req.active)
            revert Deactivated();
        
        req.active = false;
        collateral.transfer(owner, collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
    }

    function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
        Request memory req = loan.request;


        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();


        if (!loan.rollable)
            revert NotRollable();


        uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);


        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.expiry += req.duration;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
    }


    /// @notice delegate voting power on collateral
    /// @param to address to delegate
    function delegate (address to) external {
        if (msg.sender != owner) 
            revert OnlyApproved();
        IDelegateERC20(address(collateral)).delegate(to);
    }
```

## Impact

Anyone can call loan or repay accidentally.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add onlyOwner check in both functions.
```solidity
        if (msg.sender != owner) 
            revert OnlyApproved();
```
