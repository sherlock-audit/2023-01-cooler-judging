# Requesting a loan locks collateral until a lender clears fulfills the request

## Summary

As a borrower, I would call `request` in order to create a loan request. However, doing so would transfer my collateral to the balance of the Cooler right away. This is locking my funds while I'm expecting my fund to be locked only when the actual loan is created. Indeed, my request might even never be fulfilled and it that case I would have locked those funds for nothing.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

Users might not use the contract if they notice that their funds are locked until the loan is fulfilled (which might never happen).

## Recommendation

Why not simply transferring the collateral **when the loan is actually fulfilled**. If the collateral funds are still available the transaction will be ok. If the funds cannot cover for the debt anymore (balance of collateral < needed collateral to cover for the loan) then the transaction would revert. This would move the responsibility of maintaining a sufficient balance of collateral back to the user and until the loan is fulfilled but in the meantime, the borrower could still use his/her funds if needed.
