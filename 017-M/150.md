# If   an attacker reenters `repay` function , they can remove all the funds from the borrower and lender

## Summary
If an attacker reenters `repay` function, they can remove all the funds from the borrower and lender
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say the debt token is an erc20 token with `beforeTransferHook`on `msg.sender` they can reenter with the full amount and the owner won't get their funds and the lender won't get their debt tokens 
so if `msg.sender` repays  max tokens - 1wei they can reenter and only pay 1 Wei but leave lender and borrower without their funds back
 The same thing can be done with the `roll` function.An attacker can reenter and since the state updates before the transfer, the attacker can reenter and get more collateral for free.
## Impact
Loss of funds for lender and borrower
## Code Snippet
an attacker can give back max tokens - 1 wei and only leave 1 wei in the loan but then we reenter before the transfer of both lender and borrower and they both will lose their funds.The msg.sender will give lender and borrower 1 wei and the rest will be lost
```solidity
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) revert Default();

        uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
        else {
            loan.amount -= repaid;
            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
        }

        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
```
```solidity
    uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(
            loan.amount,
            req.loanToCollateral
        ) - loan.collateral;
       
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.expiry += req.duration;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
    }
