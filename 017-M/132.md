# Missing ReEntrancy Guard to repay function

## Summary
There is no re-entry risk on true ERC-20 tokens that work according to the spec (i.e. audited, etc.).

However you can write a malicious ERC-20 with custom safetransferFrom() or approve() that have re-entrancy hooks to attack a target.

Furthermore ERC-777 is backwards compatible token standard with ERC-20 standard. ERC-777 has better usability, but it has transfer hooks that can cause re-entrancy.

In documents; It is listed as "ERC777 : None " but there is nothing preventing it

## Vulnerability Detail

ERC20 generally doesn't result in reentrancy, however ERC777 tokens can and they can maskerade as ERC20. So if a contract interacts with unknown ERC20 tokens it is better to be safe and consider that transfers can create reentrancy problems.

Although reentrancy attack is considered quite old over the past two years, there have been cases such as:

Uniswap/LendfMe hacks (2020) ($25 mln, attacked by a hacker using a reentrancy)

The BurgerSwap hack (May 2021) ( $7.2 million because of a fake token contract and a reentrancy exploit.)

The SURGEBNB hack (August 2021) ($4 million seems to be a reentrancy-based price manipulation attack.)

CREAM FINANCE hack (August 2021) ($18.8 million, reentrancy vulnerability allowed the exploiter for the second borrow.)

Siren protocol hack (September 2021) ($3.5 million, AMM pools were exploited through reentrancy attack.)

Type of Reentrancy

[Details](https://inspexco.medium.com/cross-contract-reentrancy-attack-402d27a02a15)
1 - Single Function Reentrancy
2 - Cross-Function Reentrancy
3 - Cross-Contract Reentrancy

## Impact
[Cooler.sol#L108-L124](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L108-L124)


## Code Snippet

```js
src/Cooler.sol:
  107      /// @param repaid debt tokens to repay
  108:     function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
  109:         Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
  110: 
  111:         if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
  112:             revert Default();
  113:         
  114:         uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
  115: 
  116:         if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
  117:         else {
  118:             loan.amount -= repaid;
  119:             loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
  120:         }
  121: 
  122:         debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
  123:         collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
  124:     }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use Openzeppelin or Solmate Re-Entrancy pattern

Here is a example of a re-entracy guard

```js
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract ReEntrancyGuard {
    bool internal locked;

    modifier noReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "No re-entrancy");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
}
```
