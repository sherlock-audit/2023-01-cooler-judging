# ClearingHouse can only handle tokens with 18 decimals

## Summary
ClearingHouse can only handle tokens with 18 decimals. Currently it's only possible to deploy token-pairs where both tokens have 18 decimals. A usdc-gOHM pair is not possible at the moment.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently the ClearingHouse is using hardcoded values to check if they can accept a loan via `ClearingHouse.clear` or not.

```solidity
File: src/aux/ClearingHouse.sol
33:     uint256 public constant minimumInterest = 2e16; // 2%
34:     uint256 public constant maxLTC = 2_500 * 1e18; // 2,500
```

If the protocol ever decides to also accept USDC-gOHM for example the current implementation for ClearingHouse can't be used as they don't scale depending on the decimals from the tokens.

## Impact
If protocol wants to use a ClearingHouse with a token-pair that is not both 18 decimals the currently fixed values will break the expectation as they're not changeable and not scaled depending on the decimals of the tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use immutable variables for `minimumInterest` and `maxLTC` that you can set on the deployment or scale the values depending on the decimals for the tokens.
