# Loan can have a very long duration because rollable is True by default

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L143

## Vulnerability Detail
Loan is created with `rollable = True` by default. It mean if borrower can roll a loan immediately after the request is cleared. Lender can call `toggleRoll()` after clearing a request. However, there is always some small window for borrower to front-run and call `roll()` multiple times.


## Impact
Loan duration will not be the same as what lender signed for. And lender did not have any way to prevent his loan from rolling (because borrower can always front-run `toggleRoll()` TX of lender and call `roll()` first).

## Code Snippet

```solidity
loan.amount += newDebt;
loan.expiry += req.duration; 
// @audit can borrow for a long time if call roll() immediately after it's cleared
loan.collateral += newCollateral;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider setting `rollable = False` by default after clearing a request.
