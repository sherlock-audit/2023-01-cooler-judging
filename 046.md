# Loans can be rolled an unlimited number of times which could result in longer loans than expected

## Summary

When loan.rollable is true the loan can be rolled an unlimited number of times with no time requirements. A lender may allow a loan to be rollable with the intent that the borrower will extend the loan as needed. The issue is that a borrower could extended the loan a large number of times and push out the expiry of the loan to an unreasonable date and lock the lenders funds for much longer than they ever intended. The borrower would have to provide additional collateral but for low interest loans it could be marginal

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

## Recommendation

Toggle rollable after a loan is rolled:

        loan.expiry += req.duration;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
