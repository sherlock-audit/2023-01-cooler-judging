# Loss of/locked airdrops/yield farming tokens

## Summary

The `Cooler` contract lacks a sweep function to recover ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens sent to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Cooler` contract allows the owner to delegate voting power on collateral. However, there is no functionality to recover tokens sent to the contract as part of airdrops or yield farming rewards.

## Impact

Airdrops or yield farming rewards (received by eligible collateral tokens) can be locked in the `Cooler` contract if the owner has no possibility to sweep the tokens.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a sweep function to recover ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens sent to the contract (callable by the owner only)
