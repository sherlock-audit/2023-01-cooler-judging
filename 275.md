# [H] Malicious borrowers can evade repayment and prevent collateral withdrawal by repeatedly rolling loans to distant future


## Summary

The vulnerability lies in the fact that if a borrower continuously uses the "roll" function to extend their loan, This can lead to a situation event the borrower not repay the loan (in the foreseeable future) and the lender is unable to recoup their collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a lender agrees to a loan, they are accepting a certain duration of the loan based on current market conditions such as the value of the collateral, interest rates, and value of the loaned asset, this does not mean that they are accepting an infinite duration of the loan under the same conditions. 

However, currently, our system sets the 'rollable' property to true when a loan is agreed on `clear()`, which in certain cases (low collateral value to loan amount or low interest rates with expected future rate increases) allows malicious borrowers to repeatedly use the `roll()` function to extend the loan to an extremely distant future and substantially elects to default.

## Impact

The impact of this issue is that it allows the borrower to indefinitely extend the loan, preventing the lender from recouping their principal and interest, and also prevents the lender from timely retrieving their collateral.

```solidity
function clear (uint256 reqID) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
        Request storage req = requests[reqID];

        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Clear);

        if (!req.active) 
            revert Deactivated();
        else req.active = false;

        uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
        uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral);
        uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;

        loanID = loans.length;
        loans.push(
            Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
        );
        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);
    }
```

            revert Default();

        if (!loan.rollable)
            revert NotRollable();

        uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);

        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.expiry += req.duration;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
    }

## Recommendation

Consider:

change `clear()` to:

```solidity
function clear (uint256 reqID, bool rollable) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
        Request storage req = requests[reqID];

        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Clear);

        if (!req.active) 
            revert Deactivated();
        else req.active = false;

        uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
        uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral);
        uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;

        loanID = loans.length;
        loans.push(
            Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, rollable, msg.sender)
        );
        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);
    }
```

change `roll()` to :

```solidity
function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
    // Check if the loan is rollable
    if (!loans[loanID].rollable) revert NotRollable();
    // Check if the loan is expired
    if (block.timestamp > loans[loanID].expiry) revert Default();
    // Check if the maximum roll times reached
    if (loans[loanID].rollCount >= maxRollTimes) 
        revert RollMaximum();
    // Check if the duration of the loan exceeded the maximum
    if (block.timestamp - loans[loanID].loanTime > maxDuration) 
        revert DurationMaximum();
    // Check if the lender has enough collateral to roll the loan
    if (loans[loanID].collateral < loans[loanID].amount * collateralRatio)
        revert InsufficientCollateral();
    // If all checks passed, roll the loan
    loans[loanID].rollCount ++;
    loans[loanID].expiry += duration;
