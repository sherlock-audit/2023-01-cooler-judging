# The protocol doesn't account for `ETH` transfers

## Summary

The protocol fails to account for cases where `ETH` may be used in the system.

## Vulnerability Detail

The possibility of the use `ETH` in the system should be accounted for. . For instance, use of `transfer()` might render `ETH` impossible to withdraw  because after istanbul hardfork due to increases in the gas cost of the `SLOAD` operation and therefore breaks some existing smart  contracts.

It would also be necessary to implement `receive` and `fallback` functions to handle `ETH` transfers.

## Impact

The protocol will be unable to handle `ETH` transactions.

## Recommendation

Account for specific cases where `ETH` is used. Alternatively implement measures to exclude the use of `ETH` if that's what the protocol owners decide.
