# Lack of access control on `request()` function

## Summary
Because is lack of access control on `request()` function, anyone can call it up and without any restriction create many different fake requests. This could seriously compromise the whole contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail
See summary

## Impact

```solidity
function request (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interest,
        uint256 loanToCollateral,
        uint256 duration
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
        requests.push(
            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
        );
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
    }
```
