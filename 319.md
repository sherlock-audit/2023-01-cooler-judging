# Lenders can default the loan by reverting the `repay()` function.



## Summary
Lenders can default the loan by reverting the `repay()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see [here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#tokens-with-blocklists), some tokens including `USDC` and `USDT` have blocklists and lenders that have such accounts can make `repay` revert like below.

1. A borrower created a request with `collateral = weth, debt = USDC`.
2. A lender who has a blocklisted account for USDC cleared the request.
3. After that, when the borrower tries to repay using `repay()` function, it will revert at L122 because the lender's account is a blocklisted one.

```solidity
debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
```
4. As a result, the loan will be defaulted and the lender will receive weth instead of USDC.

## Impact
Borrowers can't repay the loan so the loan will be defaulted all the time.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We can introduce a new approach to save the debt token amount in the contract instead of transferring directly.

And the lenders can withdraw from the contract later to the address they want.
