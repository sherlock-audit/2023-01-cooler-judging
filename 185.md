# Anyone may roll over any loan, even if they are not a party to it

## Summary

Any unauthorized user may roll over a loan, even if they are not involved in that loan.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `roll` function in `Cooler.sol` is unprotected. This leaves open opportunity for any actor to pick a loan and roll it over.

The `roll` function is enabled by default and not protected.

## Impact

Loss of funds from the debtor to the lender, as the rolling of the loan incurs a cost on the debtor in the form of excess interest.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
Cooler victimCooler = address(/* victim address */);
victimCooler.roll(0); // roll over an arbitrary loan, even though we are not a party to it
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a permissions check such that only the debtor may roll over a loan.
