# Unable to transfer loan ownership

## Summary
Due to no approveOwnershipChange function in ClearingHouse it will be unable to call Cooler.approve and change owners of the loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
When ClearingHouse is used to clear a loan in Cooler.clear() the loan.lender is set to [msg.sender](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L176-L178) which is the ClearingHouse contract. 
If the lender wishes to transfer ownership either to another person or another address they will need to call the Cooler.approve function. However to pass the [if statement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L215) in Cooler.approve they must call this as the current loan.lender which is the clearinghouse contract and it has no corresponding function to call Cooler.approve, preventing ownership to ever be changed.

## Impact
The ClearingHouse will never be able to transfer ownership of the loan.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an approveOwnershipChange function in ClearingHouse that calls Cooler.approve().
