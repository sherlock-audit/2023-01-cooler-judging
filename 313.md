# Since when a loan is cleared rollable=true an attacker can do many diffrent thinks with that like rolling over loan with frontrunning and getting more debt with out paying collateral

## Summary
Since when clearing a  loan, rollable by default=true.By doing that, when clearing a loan, a user/borrower/attacker can come and do many options like roll off a loan for free/ bypass the clearinghouse duration for the loan.
## Vulnerability Detail
case 1:
lender and borrower match a loan and right after the clear tx The borrower rolls over the loan  with back running and gets more debt without spending collateral
it results: huge debt  on the loan for free(on Hugh loan this is big loss)
ex:
1. lender calls clear
2. borrower front-runs the lender's call to toggle the roll off with the higher gas fee and gets more debt without paying collateral because nothing has happened with the loan yet. They can loop in the roll function with high gas fees getting unlimited debt for free.
case 2:
the same thing as above but instead of the borrower it's a random user and since when `newcollateral=0`  the user can inflict debt on the borrower and cause a huge debt ceiling.
case 3:
the borrower clears the loan in the auction house and they have a limit of 365 days but since we can roll over with the lender approving it we can bypass the limit on the duration of the loan.
## Impact
loss of funds 
## Code Snippet
on default loan is rollable
```solc
   loans.push(
            Loan(
                req,
                req.amount + interest,
                collat,
                expiration,
                true,
                msg.sender
            )
        );
```
when `newCollateral=0` which is true for the examples above because the collateral and new collateral are calculated the same way and one of the only ways to make `newCollateral>0` we would have to repay some of the loans but we are not doing that and we are just getting the newcollateral - collateral and since they updated every time it should be zero.
ex:
`colateral=100`
`newcollateral= 100`=0
and since we increment by 5 every time the 
`collateral=105`
and `newcollateral=105`=0 

```solidity

        uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(
            loan.amount,
            req.loanToCollateral
        ) - loan.collateral;
       
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.expiry += req.duration;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);



```

## Tool used


Manual Review

## Recommendation
I put them in the same issue because the underlying issue is the same on default `rollable=true` 
some suggestions for some of the mitigation if `rollable !=false` on the clearing of the loan
1. roll makes onlyowner so nobody can have changed to make more debt for the owner 
**The overall fix** 
make rollable=false on the clearing of a loan
```solidity
   loans.push(
            Loan(
                req,
                req.amount + interest,
                collat,
                expiration,
                false,
                msg.sender
            )
        );

```
