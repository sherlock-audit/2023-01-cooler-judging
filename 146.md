# Unchecked return values of `transfer` and `transferFrom`

## Summary
If a non reverting ERC-20 is used as a `collateral` or a `debt` token, then `Cooler` will face multiple issues leading to loss of user funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
While most ERC-20 token implementations revert on failure of `transfer` and `transferFrom`, it is not mandatory. Since return values of `transfer` and `transferFrom` are never checked, then if a `debt` or `collateral` token that does not revert on failure is used, many issues arise, for exmaple:

- In `request()` the borrower does not approve the `Cooler` before calling. `transferFrom()` fails silently and no collateral is sent to the cooler, but the request is well registered and can be cleared later by a lender.
- In `clear()`, the lender does not approve the `Cooler` before calling. `transferFrom()` fails silently and no debt token is sent to the borrower, but the loan is well registered and must be later repayed by the borrower even if it didn't receive any loan in the first place.

## Impact
Multiple issues leading to loss of user funds arise if non-reverting `transfer` and `transferFrom` ERC20 are used.
