# Lender call to `toggleRoll` can be frontrun

## Summary
A borrower can call `roll` against the will of the lender.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a lender call `clear` the value of the `loan.rollable` is hardcoded to `true` as a consequence the borrower can always call `roll` by either frontrunning the call of the lender to `toggleRoll` or by backrunning the call to `clear`.

## Impact
A borrower can call `roll` (potentially several times) against the will of the lender. The only way a lender can prevent a borrower to call `roll` is by sending a private bundle of transactions with a call to `clear` and `toggleRoll` to flashbots. 

## Code Snippet
[Cooler.sol#L185](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L185)
```solidity
    function toggleRoll(uint256 loanID) external returns (bool) {
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend letting the lender choose whether or not the loan is rollable inside `clear`.
