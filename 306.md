# Unsafe arithmetic operations

## Summary

The protocol is using one of the well known arithmetic operation method which could cause the truncation of the final result.

It does the division first followed by the multiplication.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

It has the following impacts.

1. the final result would be truncated.
2. or the final result would be zeroed out depend of the numerator and denominator value. If the numerator < denominator, the division would result in zero.
