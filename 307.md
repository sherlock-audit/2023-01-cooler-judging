# SOME AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL CAN BE STUCK IN ESCROW

## Summary

In `repay` method, the collateral to be released is calculated by a mathematical calculation with include division.

## Vulnerability Detail

In EVM, as there are no Floating points, the `decollateralized` value will always take the floor value of the calculation ignore the latter part. If borrower is paying back in multiple transactions, he/she will loss some amount of collateral because of this.

## Impact

Loss of Collateral for Borrower despite paying back the complete Loan Amount.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: Cooler.sol

    function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();
        
        uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
        else {
            loan.amount -= repaid;
            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
        }

        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
    }

```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When the repaid amount is equal to loan amount, transfer all the remaining collateral in the escrow to the Borrower. 

Can use a new state variable to keep a track on this which will make sure that no amount of collateral is stuck inside escrow.
