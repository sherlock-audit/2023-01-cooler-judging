# Borrower has to pay more interest if he wants to call repay() early

## Summary

Borrower pays more interest because interest rate is not varied with duration.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the borrower asks for a duration for 1 year but pays within a month, the borrower has to pay the interest of the year instead of the month. Interest is calculated by adding req.amount + interest. This interest takes into account the full sum of interest the borrower has to pay.

        uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
        uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral);
        uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;


        loanID = loans.length;
        loans.push(
            Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
        );
        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);

If the borrower decides to repay early, then he still incur the full sum of interest.

        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
        else {
            loan.amount -= repaid;
            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
        }


        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);

## Impact
