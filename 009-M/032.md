# Fee on transfer token - Lesser collateral collected

## Summary
On using a collateral which charges fee on transfer, the `request` function will collect lesser collateral than expected. 

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume Token X is used as collateral which has fee on transfer enabled
2. Request function is called with collateral X and lets say `collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral)` comes to be 500
3. The contract will transfer collateral of amount 500

```solidity
collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
``` 

4. The problem is since X takes fees so contract only receives 450 amount (50 fees)
5. Lets say this borrower defaults and lender calls `defaulted` function

```solidity
function defaulted (uint256 loanID) external returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID];
        delete loans[loanID];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) 
            revert NoDefault();

        collateral.transfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
        return loan.collateral;
    }
```

6. This transfer all collateral to lender which is 450. But again since transfer has fee, lender only receives 400 amount. Lender hence incur loss of 100 amount whereas Borrower receives funds for full 500 amount

## Impact
If the borrower defaults then lender will get collateral-(2*fees). If fees is high, he will receive lower collateral causing loss

## Recommendation
Remove support for fee on transfer token. Even if problem of fee on transfer token is resolved at request time, it eventually becomes problem on `defaulted` scenario where lender will get lesser collateral due to fees

Simply check the balance before and after passing collateral. If the difference does not matches the amount then reject the request
