# Rebasing Tokens rewards are locked in the contract and cannot be retrieved by the borrower

## Summary
Rebasing tokens are tokens that have each holderâ€™s balanceof() increase over time. Aave aTokens are an example of such tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

A user may add for example aTokens as collateral and get a loan based on them. When he repays the loan he will only get the amount he added and all his rewards are stuck for ever in the contract.

## Impact

Losing rewards for rebase tokens.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L108-L124
```solidity
function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();
        
        uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
        else {
            loan.amount -= repaid;
            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
        }

        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract should be tracking the balanceof() and resend the borrower all his tokens with the rewards.
