# Fee on transfer tokens are not supported

## Summary
ClearingHouse will not be working correctly with fee on transfer tokens as he doesn't check the balance and fully trust to amount provided by users.
## Vulnerability Detail
defund() does not check the incoming token type, but directly transfers a specific amount (amount) of the specified token. If the token is a token that requires a handling fee for transfer, then there will be problems in transferring the amount.
## Impact
ClearingHouse will not be working correctly with fee on transfer tokens as he doesn't check the balance and fully trust to amount provided by users.
## Code Snippet

    function defund (ERC20 token, uint256 amount) external {
        if (msg.sender != operator && msg.sender != overseer) 
            revert OnlyApproved();
        token.transfer(treasury, amount); //@audit  
    }
```
