# ClearingHouse: unable to retrieve collateral from treasury

## Summary
The fund function of ClearingHouse does not allow privileged users to retrieve gOHM.
## Vulnerability Detail
In Cooler contracts, when the borrower fails to repay the loan, the collateral is sent to the lender.
In ClearingHouse, privileged users can send arbitrary tokens(dai and gOHM) to treasury through defund, but in the fund function, privileged users are only allowed to take out dai, which causes the collateral gOHM in treasury to not be taken out.
## Impact
it causes the collateral gOHM in treasury to not be taken out.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider allowing privileged users to withdraw any token in treasury through fund
Change to
```solidity
    function fund (ERC20 token, uint256 amount) external {
        if (msg.sender != overseer) 
            revert OnlyApproved();
        ITreasury(treasury).manage(address(token), amount);
    }

```
