# Voting Delegation is allowed even loan is defaulted and the collateral owner is the sender

## Summary
The `Cooler` contract allows for the collateral owner to delegate their voting power via the `delegate ()` function as seen here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L151. 

As such, in cases where the collateral allows for governance and voting delegation, the borrower can delegate their voting power to an address of their choice. 

However, the contract fails to consider certain scenarios where ownership of collateral has changed. Such a case is where the loan is defaulted and the `loan.lender` is now the owner of the collateral. The `Cooler` contract allows for borrower to have unlimited powers over the collateral such that they can always delegate the collateral voting powers to whoever they choose. Remember in the context of the `Cooler` contract, the `owner` is marked `immutable` hence this address cannot be changed once it has been deployed as seen here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L45. 

The project should consider to limit delegation to only when the loan is active and upon loan default, to transfer the delegation to the `loan.lender` because the collateral would have been transferred to the `loan.lender` as seen here:

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Cooler` contract allows for the collateral owner to delegate voting power to an address of their choosing if their collateral allows as seen in the `delegate` function here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L151. 

Once a loan is defaulted the collateral is transferred to the `loan.lender` as seen here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L198-L208. As a result, the borrower should not have any control over the collateral at this point because the collateral has been transferred to the `loan.lender`. But the borrower can still use the `delegate ()` function to delegate the voting power of the collateral to an address of their choosing at any time. Remember the borrower by default is the collateral owner and is set upon deployment. More so, the owner is `immutable` as seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L45 meaning the borrower will always remain the collateral owner in the context of the `Cooler` contract. 

Ideally, once collateral is transferred to the `loan.lender` once a loan is defaulted, the borrower should not have any control over the asset including delegating its voting powers. 
## Impact
The borrower can have control over the collateral and delegate powers even when they have defaulted loan payment and the collateral is transferred to `loan.lender`. Therefore, they can always delegate the voting power at any time to anyone.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider limiting voting delegation to only when the loan is active. You can add the following check:
``` solidity
function delegate (address to) external {
        if (msg.sender != owner && block.timestamp > loan.expiry)
            revert OnlyApproved();

        IDelegateERC20(address(collateral)).delegate(to);
    }
