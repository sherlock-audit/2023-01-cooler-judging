# MinimumInterest in ClearingHouse.sol is calculated incorrectly

## Summary

MinimumInterest in ClearingHouse.sol is calculated incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both gOhm and DAI has 18 decimal places. 2e16 of either token is 0.02. In ClearingHouse.sol, minimumInterest is supposed to be 2% , not 0.02 DAI. For example, if a borrower is asking for 1000 DAI with an interest of 2% , the borrower has to pay an extra 20 DAI, not 0.02 DAI.

```solidity
    uint256 public constant minimumInterest = 2e16; // 2%
        .
        .
        .
        (
            uint256 amount, 
            uint256 interest, 
            uint256 ltc, 
            uint256 duration,
        ) = cooler.requests(id);
        if (interest < minimumInterest) 
            revert InterestMinimum();
```

Since that parameter interest from the struct request is the annualized % of 'amount', minimumInterest should also check against the amount borrowed. If amount borrowed is 1000 DAI, interest is 1%, 10 DAI, then minimum Interest should be 2%, 20 DAI (check fails), instead of 0.02DAI (check passes).


## Impact

Interest terms to be validated is too small.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make sure the minimum interest (2%) is calculated properly. Divide against the amount borrowed to find the actual minimum interest.
