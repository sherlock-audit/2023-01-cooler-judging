# Lender prevents being defaulted() by changing the lender address

## Summary
Lender prevents being defaulted() by changing the lender address
## Vulnerability Detail
The `lender` can change the address of `loans[loanID].lender` through `approve()` and `transfer()`. However, in `defaulted()`, the timed-out lender will be liquidated and the collateral of the lender will be transferred. But if the lender address has changed at this time, and there is no collateral. then the `defaulted()` function call will fail.
## Impact

```solidity
    function defaulted (uint256 loanID) external returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID];
        delete loans[loanID];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) 
            revert NoDefault();

        collateral.transfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
        return loan.collateral;
    }

    /// @notice approve transfer of loan ownership to new address
    /// @param to address to approve
    /// @param loanID index of loan in loans[]
    function approve (address to, uint256 loanID) external {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID];

        if (msg.sender != loan.lender)
            revert OnlyApproved();

        approvals[loanID] = to;
    }

    /// @notice execute approved transfer of loan ownership
    /// @param loanID index of loan in loans[]
    function transfer (uint256 loanID) external {
        if (msg.sender != approvals[loanID])
            revert OnlyApproved();

        approvals[loanID] = address(0);
        loans[loanID].lender = msg.sender;
    }
```
