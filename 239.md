# Use of tokens with decimals != 18 can lead to wrong calculation of debt and collateral.

## Summary
Due to the use of hardcoded `decimals`, using tokens with `decimals != 18` will result in wrong calculation of debt and collateral amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
`collateralFor` and `interestFor` use the hardcoded `decimals` value during their calculations. Therefore the resulting amounts from those functions will be overstimated/underestimated depending if the debt and/or collateral tokens have `decimals > 18` or `decimals < 18`.

## Impact
The affected functions, `collateralFor` and `interestFor` are used for `request`, `clear` and `roll`. Consequently `loan.amount` and `loan.collateral` will be wrongly calculated during loan creation and rolling.
Funds are not at direct risk here, but the correct work of the protocol is compromised.

## Tool used
Manual Review.

## Recommendation
Consider checking for the number of decimals in debt and collateral token on the constructor and generate correct decimals value based on it.
