# Use safetransfer/safetransferfrom instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Summary

The contracts use transfer/transferFrom functions which can cause issues with some tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

ERC20 implementations are not always consistent. Some implementations of `transfer` and `transferFrom` could return ‘false’ on failure instead of reverting. It is safer to wrap such calls into `require()` statements or use safe wrapper functions implementing return value/data checks to handle these failures. For reference, see similar Medium-severity finding from [[Consensys Diligence Audit of Aave Protocol V2](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/09/aave-protocol-v2/#unhandled-return-values-of-transfer-and-transferfrom)](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/09/aave-protocol-v2/#unhandled-return-values-of-transfer-and-transferfrom).

One such example is BADGER token (0x3472a5a71965499acd81997a54bba8d852c6e53d), the implementation of BADGER is not ERC20-compliant, which returns false when the sender does not have enough token to transfer (both for transfer and transferFrom).

## Impact

Assume one such coin is used as debt. 

In case of loan repay, if any such coin is used, the contract will assume that the debt is paid even if the `transferFrom` returns false and the transaction should revert. This would incorrectly send collateral back to the lender even when they don’t pay the debt.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();
        
        uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
        else {
            loan.amount -= repaid;
            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
        }

        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
    }
```
