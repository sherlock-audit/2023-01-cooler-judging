# DAI/gOHM exchange rate may be stale

## Summary

The `maxLTC` variable is a constant which implies a specific DAI/gOHM echange rate. The exchange rate has already changed so the current value in use will be wrong, and any value chosen now will eventually be out of date.


## Vulnerability Detail

The `ClearingHouse` allows any loan to go through (assuming the `operator` approves it, and the `operator` is likely some sort of keeper program), and decides whether the terms are fair based on the hard-coded `maxLTC`, which will be (and is already - gOHM is currently worth $2,600) out of date. 

If the code had been using a Chainlink oracle, this issue would be equivalent to not checking whether the price used to determine the loan-to-collateral ratio was stale, which is a Medium-severity issue.

It's not clear who or what exactly will be in control of the `operator` address which will make the `clear()` calls, but it will likely be a keeper which, unless programmed otherwise, would blindly approve such loans. Even if the `operator` is an actual person, the fact that there are coded checks for the `maxLTC`, means that the person/keeper can't be fully trusted, or that the code is attempting to protect against mistakes, so this category of mistake should also be added.


## Impact

Under-collateralized loans will be given, and borrowers will purposely take loans default, since they can use the loan amount to buy more collateral than they would lose during default.


## Code Snippet

The maximum loan-to-collateral is hard-coded, rather than being based on an oracle price:
```solidity
// File: src/aux/ClearingHouse.sol : ClearingHouse.maxLTC   #1

34:@>     uint256 public constant maxLTC = 2_500 * 1e18; // 2,500
```

If the gOHM price drops below $2500 to say $2000, a loan for 2500 DAI will only require 1 gOHM of collateral, even though it should require at least 1.2 gOHM in order to be fully-collateralized:
```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.collateralFor()   #2

236        function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
237 @>         return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
238:       }
```

## Recommendation

Use a chainlink oracle to determine the right prices to use when coming up with the maximum loan-to-collateral, for _each_ loan
