# Use `nonReentrant` for functions that involve token transfers

## Summary

The protocol accepts tokens that are specified by the borrower. It is therefore important to protect against reentrancy for functions that involve token transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail

A function such as `Cooler::repay` involves token transfers affecting all the three parties (borrower, lender and escrow).

```solidity
        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
```

Add the fact that the debt and collateral tokens are specified by a borrower means that extra care should be taken to prevent reentrancies. 

## Impact

Lenders could be exploited.
