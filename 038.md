# No ACL on roll

## Summary
If the rolling is allowed, then attacker can simply call roll function and cause loan rollover even when it was not required

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume `loan.rollable` is true for loan id 1
2. Attacker simply calls `roll` function with loan id 1
3. Since there is no ACL check so loan get rolled over even when both borrower and lender never wanted the same

```solidity
function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
        Request memory req = loan.request;

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();

        if (!loan.rollable)
            revert NotRollable();

        uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);

        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.expiry += req.duration;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
    }
```

## Impact
Loan rollover ACL is missing
