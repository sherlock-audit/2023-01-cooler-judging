# Unsafe ERC20 operations could lead to loss of funds

## Summary

Unsafe ERC20 operations could lead to loss of funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently, there are no restrictions as to which tokens can be used on the protocol. This opens up to certain attacks on the users of the protocol. 

For starter, a malicious borrower might deploy a Cooler contract using a token as collateral that does not revert on failed transfer, causing the request for a loan to be created, but no collateral actually deposited on the Cooler contract. At this stage, a lender would clear a request by transferring their tokens, and upon default, the lender would not be able to claim the collateral due to the tokens not being in the contract.

On the other hand, the Cooler contract creator might request a loan for a token that does not revert on failed transfer, and thus a lender could clear a request without actually transferring any tokens. At this point, the borrower would not be able to rescind their request, and would lose access to the collateral. This scenario assumes an oversight on the borrower side, thus being less likely than the first scenario.

## Impact

Either user (borrower or lender) might lose funds. 

## Code Snippet

- `Cooler.sol` [***request***](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L85) 

```javascript
function request (
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 interest,
    uint256 loanToCollateral,
    uint256 duration
) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
    [...snip]
    // @audit unchecked transfer
    collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
}
```

- `Cooler.sol` [***clear***](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L179)

```js
function clear (uint256 reqID) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
    [...snip]
    // @audit unchecked transfer
    debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);
}
```

- `Cooler.sol`[ ***roll***](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L146)

```js
function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
    [...snip]
    // @audit unchecked transfer
    collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
}
```

- `Cooler.sol` [***defaulted***](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L205)
This function which would then be called by the lender, would result in no collateral being transferred to them. 

```js
function defaulted (uint256 loanID) external returns (uint256) {
    Loan memory loan = loans[loanID];
    delete loans[loanID];

    if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) 
        revert NoDefault();

    collateral.transfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
    return loan.collateral;
}
```

Other functions where a library for safe ERC20 transfers should be used:

- `Cooler.sol` [***repay***](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L205) 
- `Cooler.sol` [***rescind***](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L90)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that token transfers use a library such as OpenZeppelin's [`SafeERC20`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol). This would result in the function reverting should the transfer be unsuccessful. 

The library can be imported in the code and used by adding the following directive:

```js
using SafeERC20 for ERC20;
```

Now, all ERC20 objects can use `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom`.
