# `ClearingHouse` does not require collateral for small amounts

## Summary

The `ClearingHouse` does not require collateral for small amounts, so attackers can get free loans and abandon them without consequence


## Vulnerability Detail

The `ClearingHouse` ensures that the loan-to-collateral ratio is low enough, but doesn't account for the fact that there is a loss of precision when amounts are small.


## Impact

The `ClearingHouse` uses a maximum loan-to-collateral of [2,500 * 1e18](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/aux/ClearingHouse.sol#L34), but if the `amount` passed to `collateralFor()` (used during `cooler.clear()`) is below 2,500, the calculation rounds down to zero, and no collateral is required.

An attacker can creat millions of these small-amount loan requests and pass them to the `ClearingHouse`, where they'll be cleared. Since there will be zero collateral required, the attacker will never pay back any of the loans.

It's not clear who or what exactly will be in control of the `operator` address which will make the `clear()` calls, but it will likely be a keeper which, unless programmed otherwise, would blindly approve such loans. Even if the `operator` is an actual person, the fact that there are coded checks for the `minimumInterest` and `maxDuration`, means that the person/keeper can't be fully trusted, or that the code is attempting to protect against mistakes, so this category of mistake should also be added.

Note that this scenario is separate from the general case of users choosing bad `loanToCollateral` or `minimumInterest` values, because in the general case, presumably both parties have validated the terms, and not having done so would be a user error, whereas in this scenario, the validation logic is laid out and can be inspected, and is a part of the code being audited.


## Code Snippet

The calculation below will return zero if `amount` is less than 2500:
```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.collateralFor()   #1

236        function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
237 @>         return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
238:       }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L236-L238

There is no validation that the collateral ends up being non-zero
```solidity
// File: src/aux/ClearingHouse.sol : ClearingHouse.clear()   #2

58        function clear (Cooler cooler, uint256 id) external returns (uint256) {
59            if (msg.sender != operator) 
60                revert OnlyApproved();
...
75 @>         // Validate terms
76            if (interest < minimumInterest) 
77                revert InterestMinimum();
78            if (ltc > maxLTC) 
79                revert LTCMaximum();
80            if (duration > maxDuration) 
81                revert DurationMaximum();
82    
83            // Clear loan
84            dai.approve(address(cooler), amount);
85 @>         return cooler.clear(id);
86:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`require()` that the `collateralFor()` of the loan is non-zero
