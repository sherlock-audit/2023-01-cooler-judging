# Borrower does not need to pay back loan when collateral loses value, causing loan to be under-collateralized

## Summary
There is no liquidation mechanism that liquidates the loan when the collateral loses value.
This means that when collateral loses value, there is no incentive for the borrower to pay back the loan. This is a loss for the lender who only receives the collateral that is worth less now than the amount lent.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume the following:
Borrower borrows 1000 USDC and provides 0.1 BTC as collateral. The current price of BTC is $20,000.
This means the borrower has borrowed $1000 with a collateral of $2000.

Now BTC loses value and the price of BTC is now $5000.

There is now no incentive for the borrower to pay back the 1000 USDC because he will only receive $500 worth of BTC.
The borrower is better off waiting for the loan to expire.

## Impact
When collateral loses value, the loan can become under-collateralized, leaving the borrower better off when he does not repay the loan.
