# Wrong calculation in collateralFor function

## Summary

In function `collateralFor` it is supposed to return the collateral amount for the amount of o loan and loan to collateral ratio, this function works fine with tokens that have the same decimals but with tokens with different decimals, it returns a wrong amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

Given an example:

1. `Cooler` contract with WETH as collateral and USDC as debt
2. Borrower creates a request:

```solidity
{
	amount: 1_000_000 * (10**6), //1M USDC
	interest: 0.02 * (10**18), //2%
	loanToCollateral: 0.5 * (10**18), //1 WETH = 0.5 USDC
	duration: 1 years,
}
```

1. Because of differences in decimals between USDC and WETH the amount of collateral is calculated incorrectly

```solidity
function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
	//return: 1_000_000 * (10**6) * 1 * (10**18) / 0.5 * (10**18)
  return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
}
```

1. The return value is `500_000 * (10**6)` , but it was expected to be `500_000 * (10**18)`
2. The borrower is depositing much less than expected and the lender could be affected if he checks only loanToCollateral value

## Impact

The expected amount of collateral needed is different from what is currently calculated, letting the borrower pay more/less than expected for a loan, could affect a lender if he just checks loanToCollateral input.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L236-L238

```solidity
function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `collateralFor` should take into account the decimals from collateral and debt

```diff
function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {  
	- return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
	+ uint256 collatDecimals = collateral.decimals();
	+ uint256 debtDecimals = debt.decimals();
	+ return (amount * decimals *  collatDecimals) / (loanToCollateral * debtDecimals);
}
```
