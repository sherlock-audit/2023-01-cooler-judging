# Lack of Past Date Check in "request()" Function



Description: The "request()" function in the provided code allows users to set the "duration" field of a Request struct to a value in the past. This can cause issues with the functionality and accuracy of the system that uses this function.

Impact: Setting the duration in the past can cause unexpected results, such as the loan being considered overdue before it is even disbursed. This can lead to confusion and mistrust in the system.

Proof of Concept: A user can call the "request()" function and pass in a value for the "duration" parameter that is a timestamp in the past. This will create a Request struct with a duration field set to a past date.

Recommendation: A check should be added to the "request()" function to verify that the "duration" value passed in as a parameter is not in the past.
