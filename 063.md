# Borrowers Can Fake Repay For Some ERC20s

## Summary

There is an unchecked `transferFrom` ([L122](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L122)) in the `repay` function in [Cooler.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol) which allows borrowers to fake repayment for some ERC20s. Not all ERC20s revert on failure of their `transferFrom` function. For example, [STASIS EURO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdB25f211AB05b1c97D595516F45794528a807ad8#code) returns `false` if an address is blocked. There are many reasons an ERC20 `transferFrom` may fail and if a malicious user knows how to trigger a failure they can take assets from the lender. 

## Vulnerability Detail

An example malicious path is as follows. A bad actor EOA is blocked by STASIS EURO. The bad actor requests a loan with USDC as collateral and STASIS EURO as debt. The bad actor honey pots a lender by making the loan look very profitable. An unaware lender accepts the loan and the bad actor "repays" the debt in full. The bad actor is blocked by STASIS EURO so the `transferFrom` returns `false` and does not revert. The bad actor still receives their collateral back and gets away with the stolen debt.

## Impact

Malicious borrowers can steal funds from lenders with certain ERC20s at no cost (aside from gas). 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
108:    function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
109:        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
110:
111:	    if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
112:            revert Default();
113:    
114:	    uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
115:
116:        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
117:        else {
118:            loan.amount -= repaid;
119:            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
120:        }
121:
122:        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
123:        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
124:    }
```

## Recommendation

Check the return value of `transferFrom`.
