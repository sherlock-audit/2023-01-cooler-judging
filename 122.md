# Protocol assumes that all ERC20 tokens have 18 decimals

## Summary

Protocol assumes that all ERC20 tokens have 18 decimals. Accounting functions will be greatly impaired.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Cooler.sol, the variable decimals is set to 1e18.

```solidity
    uint256 private constant decimals = 1e18;
```

decimals is used in collateralFor() and interestFor().

```solidity
    function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
    }
    function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
        return amount * interest / decimals;
    }
```

If decimals is fixed at 18, there will be extreme accounting error in the two functions. 

Example, in interestFor. Let's say that borrower wants to borrow 1000 USDC (6 decimals) with x BNB as collateral (18 decimals), for 1 year at a rate of 10% per year (3650 annualized rate APR)

function interestFor(1000e6 (USDC), 3650(RATE), 1 years(DURATION)){

interest = 3650 * 1 years / 365 days = 3650

return 1000e6 * 3650 / 1e18 = 0

}

Rate truncates to zero. Interest is zero. Similar for collateralFor. If amount is USDC ( 6 decimals), then the collateralFor will be way higher than what is supposed to be.

## Impact

Massive impact on interest rate calculation. Truncation to zero possible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check every loan and collateral decimal placing using 10 ** ERC20(loan).decimals instead of assuming 1e18 for every token's decimal place.
