# Debtors may take out undercollateralized loans

## Summary

Loans do not charge collateral on interest owed, neither at the point of instantiation nor rolling. Thus, a debtor may take out loans of very high amount, including interest, without collateralizing the loan. The loan's amount would then be in violation of the specified `loanToCollateral` rate.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `amount` field in a `Loan` object correctly includes the interest owed. However, collateral calculations do not include this amount. Therefore, an attacker may request and clear loans with very high interest rates (and thus high amounts). This would create loans with `amount`s far in excess of the specified `loanToCollateral` rate.

As seen above, neither the `clear` nor `roll` function properly calculate the `loanToCollateral` rate. At both points, the interest is included in amount owed but not in collateral required.

## Impact

Debtors may surreptitiously take out loans far in excess of the reported `loanToCollateral` rate.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
Cooler myCooler = Cooler(address(/*cooler addr*/));

// request a loan with a very high interest rate, even though I don't have the collateral to ensure it
myCooler.request(1e18, 1e100, 1, 1 days);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the final calculated amount, rather than the interest-exempt subtotal, when calculating required collateral.
