# The protocol does not approve token transfers from the sender to the Cooler

## Summary

Coolers are not approved to be able to transfer tokens from either the lender or borrower.

## Vulnerability Detail

For various critical functions to work, Coolers should be able to spend a user's tokens. Cases include transferring loanCollateral to the Cooler and the repayment of debt.

```solidity
collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
```

```solidity
debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
```

These transfers will always fail as the Cooler isn't first approved to enable the transfers.

## Impact

This will break the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s `safeApprove()` to approve the cooler to spend the user's tokens before `transferFrom` functions are called.
