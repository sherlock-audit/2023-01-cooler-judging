# The smart contract assumes that each token have 18 decimals

## Summary
The smart contract assumes that each token from the pool has 18 decimals by hardcoding this variable  uint256 private constant decimals = 1e18;

## Vulnerability Detail
There might be users that want to create pools using Doge Coin (as collateral or debt) which has 8 decimals - https://bscscan.com/token/0xba2ae424d960c26247dd6c32edc70b295c744c43;

## Impact
The functions collateralFor & interestFor might return the wrong value => DoS for some users OR lose of funds because of bad computation

PoC: Let's say Alice created a pool that will use Doge Coin as collateral. When Bob calls the "request" function with 2 for the "amount parameter", the "collateralFor" function is called.

As DogeCoin has 8 decimals, the proper amount to transfer from Bob to the smart contract is 2 * 10 ** 8;
As this formula is used - amount * decimals / loanToCollateral - the "amount * decimals" will be 2 * 10 ** 18 which means Bob will need to pay with 1 * 10 ** 10 more tokens (an amount that could not be in his wallet);

Conclusion: Bob will have to pay more DogeCoins for a loan that have a lower value;

Same thing can happen if the pool was created with DogeCoin as debt where the "interestFor" function is used with the following formula: amount * interest / decimals;

## Recommendation
Feth the decimals for each token using the IERC20 interface;
