# Always assuming tokens to be 18 decimal

## Summary

Although most tokens are 18 decimals, there is still some tokens that exist with less or more than 18 decimal. Since the cooler support any token to be created then there is a high chance that you will create an ERC20 token with less than or more than 18 decimal. However, the contract always assumes that the token is 18 decimals and it is added as constant.
```solidity
    uint256 private constant decimals = 1e18;
```


## Vulnerability Detail

The collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256)  fuinction and the function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) function uses a constant decimal which assumes that all tokens are 18 decimals.
## Impact

This can create a huge difference between what a user might expect and what he gets.

```solidity
 /// @notice compute collateral needed for loan amount at given loan to collateral ratio
    /// @param amount of collateral tokens
    /// @param loanToCollateral ratio for loan
    function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
    }

    /// @notice compute interest cost on amount for duration at given annualized rate
    /// @param amount of debt tokens
    /// @param rate of interest (annualized)
    /// @param duration of loan in seconds
    /// @return interest as a number of debt tokens
    function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
        return amount * interest / decimals;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the function decimals of ERC20 to get the token decimal and do not depend on 18 decimal as a rule for all tokens.
