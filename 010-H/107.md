# `decimals` of debt token is not token based

## Summary
`decimals` of debt token is not dependent on the chosen debt token which leads to unwanted behaviour for the internal functions `collateralFor` and `interestFor`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The internal functions `collateralFor` and `interestFor` both take an amount of debt token as input and return a value which is calculated using the `decimals` variable. But this variable isn't token dependent, therefore if the debt token has 6 decimal places instead of the harcoded value 18 it will lead to:

- A way lower value of collateral needed to borrow an `amount` of debt token for a given `loanToCollateral` ratio.
- A way higher value of interest calculated based on an `amount` of debt token for a given `rate` and `duration`.

It is very likely that it happens since 6 decimal places token are not rare at all and tokens like USDC or USDT are very likely to be used as debt token.

## Impact
An attacker could create a cooler with very little collateral to request a very large amount of USDC. A lender veryfing the loan request would not see this problem since `collateralFor` would return the right value. The only way for a lender to make sure that he is not getting scammed would be to check the balance of the contract for the debt token. Therefore it is likely that it will happen.

## Code Snippet
[Cooler.sol#L54](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L54)
```solidity
    uint256 private constant decimals = 1e18;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`decimals` should be defined in the constructor as follows `decimals = d.decimals()` to ensure that it fits the debt token decimal places.
