# Wrong collateral calculation if token decimals are not 18

## Summary

Collateral calculation assumes token decimals will always be 18. This will lead to wrong calculation for tokens that use a different number of decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

Collateral is calculated as:

```solidity
    function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
    }
```

where `uint256 private constant decimals = 1e18;`

There are tokens that use different decimals e.g `USDC` uses `6`. This will therefore lead to either overquoting or underquoting the collateral dependent on token decimals.

## Impact

Loss of funds will result as loans can either be highly underpriced or overpriced.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Normalize the amounts by calculating the decimal difference between tokens and then dividing the collateral by the difference.
