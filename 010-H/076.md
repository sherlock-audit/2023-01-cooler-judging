# Protocol does not support tokens that are not 18 decimals

## Summary
`decimals` is hard coded as 18 in the contract. However, they are multiple tokens even commonly used ones that are not 18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

We can see from the implementation of `colleteralFor` which converts `debt` token to `collateral` token. It assumes that all involved tokens are 18 decimals. If for example, `debt` token is USDT and `collateral` token is USDC, where both are 6 decimals, this calculation will always return us a wrong value when we attempt to do the conversion.

```solidity
    function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
    }
```


## Impact
The protocol will not be able to support ERC20 tokens that is not 18 decimals, and there are many common ones such as USDC,USDT that belongs to this category.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended that we check the token's `decimals()` when doing the conversion instead of hardcoding a value.
