# Improper collateral calculation for tokens with decimals different from 18

## Summary
The `collateralFor` function will improperly compute collateral amount needed if the collateral token decimals is different from 18.
## Vulnerability Detail
In order to compute the amount of collateral needed to perform a borrow, `collateralFor` performs the following calculation: 
`amount * decimals / loanToCollateral`
The issue here is that Cooler hardcodes  the `decimals` variable to 1e18, and this will make the calculations be wrong for tokens that have decimals different from 18. Let's check different scenarios, where the input amount is 10 tokens, the loanToCollateral is 40% (or 4e17), and the expected collateral is 4 tokens:
- Scenario 1 (correctly calculated) -> User wants to borrow 4 DAI (18 decimals), depositing  gOHM token (18 decimals) as collateral, and the total collateral needed will be computed in the following way:
`collateral = 4e18 * 1e18 / 4e17 = 10e18 gOHM`
- Scenario 2 (incorrectly calculated) -> User wants to borrow 4 DAI (18 decimals), depositing USDC token (6 decimals) as collateral, and the collateral needed will be computed in the following way:
`collateral = 4e18 * 1e18 / 4e17 = 10e18 USDC` (which is a ridiculously big collateral amount of USDC because of the fact that USDC operates with 6 decimals)
- Scenario 3 (incorrectly calculated) -> User wants to borrow 4 USDC (6 decimals), depositing DAI token (18 decimals) as collateral, and the collateral needed will be computed in the following way:
`collateral = 4e6 * 1e18 / 4e17 = 1e7 DAI` (which is a ridiculously small collateral amount of USDC because of the fact that USDC operates with 6 decimals)
 
## Impact
High, this can cause a huge loss of funds for the lender in scenario 3, or obtaining a smaller borrow amount than expected in scenario 2.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L236-L238
```solidity
function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Two things are recommended in order to compute the collateral calculation succesfully:
- Allow the `decimals` variable in the contract to be dynamic. It could be obtained from the ERC20 token **that will be deposited as collateral** through the ERC20 `decimals()` method
- Clearly define in the documentation how the loan to value (or `loanToCollateral`) should be set so that users consider how ERC20 decimals can impact the collateral computation.
