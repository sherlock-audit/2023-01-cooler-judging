# `collateralFor` function truncates,tokens  that are not 18 decimals

## Summary
When a user wants a loan that is not `1e18` decimals the collateralFor function will truncate the value and the borrower will transfer fewer funds than if it was the same with 1e18 decimals but the same token.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user makes a pool with  tokens that are not 18 decimals what happens is the `collateralFor` function expects the  amount  to be  1e18 also  it gets multiplied by   1e18 
ex: user wants to pay a small amount of usdc(collateral)
`amount=1e6` * 1e18 / 100= 1e22 which would be too high of a  value because we only want a loan to be smaller than 1 usdc and here it's 1000 usdc and the user can lose their funds. because of smaller decimals, the `collateralFor` function returns either a smaller value or the bigger value than its 1e18 counterpart.
1e18 dai:= 1e34 
so with the usdc amount we can steal funds because it can be a bigger value but the function truncates it and we can get more funds  than your   1e18 counterpart
## Impact
loss of funds or weird  edge cases 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make a way to scale the decimals or figure out the decimals of each token and use the decimals var like that instead of a constant 1e18
