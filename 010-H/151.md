# Using constant number of decimals lead to a miscalculation for the `interest amount paid` that will be returned via the Cooler# `interestFor()` function.

## Summary
If some ERC20 tokens that has small number of decimals (i.e. USDC) is used as a debt token in the Cooler# `interestFor()` function, the `interest amount paid` that will be returned via the Cooler# `interestFor()` function will be miscalculated.
Because of that a constant number of decimals (1e18) is always used for the calculation in the Cooler# `interestFor()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `"decimals"` below is defined as a `constant` that constant number of decimals ( `1e18` ) is assigned like this:
[Cooler.sol#L54](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L54)
```solidity
// This makes the code look prettier.
uint256 private constant decimals = 1e18;
```

The `"decimals"` above defined as a constant is used for the calculations in the functions below:
- Cooler# ` interestFor()`
  [Cooler.sol#L247](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L247)
```solidity
    function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
        return amount * interest / decimals;  /// @audit - The "decimals" defined as a constant variable (1e18) is used here.
    }
```

On the other hand, there is some probability that some ERC20 tokens that has small decimals (i.e. USDC that is the `6` decimals token) is used as a `collateral` token or as a `debt` token in the Cooler.

However, these ERC20 tokens that has small decimals are not considered to be used as a `debt token` in the Cooler# `interestFor()` function.

Example).

An `interest cost` on amount for duration in the Cooler# `interestFor()` function is calculated and returned by using the calculation like below:
[Cooler.sol#L247](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L247)
```solidity
amount * interest / decimals
```

If USDC is used as a debt token in the Cooler# `interestFor()`, the debt amount of USDC is assigned into the `amount` parameter. But, the constant ( `1e18` is assigned) is always used `decimals` as it is despite the actual number of decimals of USDC is `1e6`.
As a result, the interest cost returned will be 1e12 times smaller than actual the interest cost.  

This lead to miscalculation for the `interest amount paid` .

## Impact
This lead to a miscalculation for the `interest amount paid` that will be returned via the Cooler# `interestFor()` function.
Also, the Cooler# `interestFor()` function is used inside the Cooler# `clear()` function and the Cooler# `roll()` function. Thus, the calculation in the these functions will also be affected by this miscalculated-value returned from the Cooler# `interestFor()` function.

## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
Consider adding the calculation in order to standardize decimals of debt token to the Cooler# `interestFor()` function like this.
```solidity
    /// @audit - Add "ERC20 debt" as a parameter.
    function interestFor(ERC20 debt, uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _decimals = debt.decimals();  /// @audit - Retrieving the actual number of decimals that debt token has.

        uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
        return amount * interest / _decimals;   /// @audit - Using "_decimals" that is calculated above.
    }
```
