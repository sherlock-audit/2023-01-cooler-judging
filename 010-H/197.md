# use of fixed decimals can cause 0 interests for borrower debt

## Summary
If the ERC20 token used for debt has less then 18 decimals the calculation for interest rate will be 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
Protocol uses fixed value of decimals in its calculations. Which cause problems for ERC20 tokens that have different number of decimals.

In case of deb interest rate calculations this is always zero for tokens with less then 18 decimals.

## Impact

If the ERC20 token used for debt has less then 18 decimals the calculation for interest rate will be 0 and consequently the lender will not accrue any interests even if he/she planned to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Two options:
1. Always require used ERC20 tokens to be 18 decimals:

```diff
constructor (address o, ERC20 c, ERC20 d) {
+   require(c.decimals() == decimals,"wrong decimals token0");
+   require(d.decimals() == decimals,"wrong decimals token1");

    owner = o;
    collateral = c;
    debt = d;
    factory = CoolerFactory(msg.sender);
}
```

2. Change math to use decimals() of ERC20 tokens.
