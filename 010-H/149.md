# Incorrect Interest Rate and Collateral for unusual ERC20 tokens

## Summary
The formula on the Interestfor and Collateralfor does not account for non standard ERC20 that do not have 18 decimals. 


## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following formula used to calculate the interest rate for a loan.

If Alice wants to borrow 1000 DAI for a duration of 30 days, the Interestfor function returns 19 as seen below

but if Alice want to borrow 1000 USDC, the function returns 19025875190000 as seen below

DAI and USDC are both stablecoins, but they return different numbers for interest rate for the same amount because DAI has 18 decimals while USDC has 6. While USDC having 6 decimals is unusual, it is a still a high volume coin. There is also USDT and WBTC also to consider for unusual high volume coins as well as any obscure coins that may or may not be maliciously created. 

The same issue is present in the Collateralfor function which also returns an incorrect amount in the same situation.

## Impact
The formula will return a precision loss if the ERC20 collateral token is an unusual ERC20 token. If the user uses the implementation in Cooler.sol, the the Interestfor function will return a different rate if it is cleared by a lender. The same issue can be found in the Collateralfor function.

## Tool used

Remix, Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the protocol is only to be used by ERC20 tokens with 18 decimals, then create a require/error handling statement to only allow tokens with 18 decimals. This may also help https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/84095/how-to-get-the-decimals-of-erc20-token-in-smart-contract
