# Loans can be rolled against the will of the lender by frontrunning their call to toggleRoll

## Summary
Loan `rollable` field set to `true` as default enables owner to frontrun the lender and call `roll` before lender can disable loan rolling.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the filling of a requested loan, the newly created `Loan` has the `rollable` field set to `true` as default. Therefore if a lender wants to create a non-rollable loan, he would have to call `clear` and then call `toggleRoll` next. During the time between loan creating and `toggleRoll` call, the loan would be susceptible to being rolled over.

## Impact
For newly created loans, an malicious actor could frontrun the lender and roll the loan against the lender's will.
