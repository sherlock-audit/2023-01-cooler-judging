# `Cooler.clear()` should set `rollable = false` when it adds the loans.


## Summary
`Cooler.clear()` should set `rollable = false` when it adds the loans.

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see from `clear()`, the initial value of `rollable` param is true.

So the borrower can roll the loan at the first time and the below scenario would be possible.

1. The borrower created a request for `duration = 1 year` and the lender filled the request using `clear()`.
2. The lender should use the debt token after 1 year and he was going to make disable `rollable = false.`
3. But right after the loan was accepted, the borrower called `roll()` using front-run and the duration was changed to 2 years.
4. As a result, the lender should wait for 2 years to get back his debt tokens.

Normally `rollable` is changeable only by lenders and it's not fair to set true at a clear time.

## Impact
The borrower would extend the loan right after it's cleared even if lenders don't like it.

## Recommendation
I think we should set `rollable = false` in `clear()` function.

        loans.push(
            Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, false, msg.sender)
        );
