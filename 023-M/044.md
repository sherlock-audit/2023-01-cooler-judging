# Cooler: loan should start out not rollable

## Summary
A loan is created when a lender calls `Cooler.clear` for a valid request.
The loan that is created has the `rollable` attribute set to `true`:

## Vulnerability Detail
Having the `rollable` attribute set to `true` allows the borrower to roll the loan.
This is unsafe. The `rollable` attribute should be set to `false` by default such that the lender must explicitly allow the borrower to roll the loan.

## Impact
The borrower can roll the loan by default which is unsafe.
It should be necessary for the lender to consent to this by calling `Cooler.toggleRoll`.
