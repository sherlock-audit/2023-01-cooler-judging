# Because the default value of `rollable` is true, function `toggleRoll` can not block the rollover

## Summary
Function `roll` in contract Cooler.sol is used to extend the loan at origination terms, and rollover can be blocked by the lender by calling the function `toggleRoll` (see [docs](https://ag0.gitbook.io/cooler-loans/servicing-and-default)). However, borrower can front-run and roll the loan before the lender calls `toggleRoll`.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
When lender clears a request by function `clear`, a new loan will be created as the following:
```solidity=
loanID = loans.length;
loans.push(
    Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
);
```
The default value of the variable `rollable` in the new loan is true. If the lender doesn't allow the rollover, he/she must call function `toggleRoll`. However, the borrower can front-run to call function `roll` (can roll many times in 1 transaction) before, and the lender can not prevent it.

## Impact
The lender can not block the rollover.

## Tool used
Manual review 

## Recommendation
The variable `rollable` of a new loan should be false as default.
```solidity=
loans.push(
    Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, false, msg.sender)
);
```
