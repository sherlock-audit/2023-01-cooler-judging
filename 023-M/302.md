# toggleRoll can be frontrunned

## Summary

If the lender doesn’t want the loan to be rollable, he/she should use the `toggleRun()` function to disable this functionality as loans are rollable by default. If the borrower monitors the mempool for this transaction, he/she could frontrun the transaction and quickly extend the loan one or more durations. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If a new loan request is created, nor borrowers or lenders can choose whether the loan is rollable upon creation. Instead, the `toggleRun()` function has to be used by the lender after the loan is created. If the borrower wishes to extend the loan but the lender disallows this by calling the `toggleRun()` function, the borrower can frontrun this action by the lender.

## Impact

Borrowers might extend loans even if the lenders do not want to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow the borrower to specify whether a loan is rollable as from the beginning. This way the `toggleRun()` function shouldn’t be used by the lender and thus cannot be frontrunned.

```solidity
function request (
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 interest,
    uint256 loanToCollateral,
    uint256 duration,
		bool rollable
) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
    reqID = requests.length;
    factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
    requests.push(
        Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, rollable)
    );
    collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
}
```
