# Lender can't disable rolling when creating a loan making the transaction back-runnable

## Summary
Borrower can back-run lender's `clear` transaction and increase loan duration by rolling it over. This may not be desired by the lender

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `clear` function loan is created with default `true` value for `rollable`
```solidity
loans.push(
    Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
);
```
In order to disable rolling lender must make another call to `toggleRoll` function. However, if borrower is faster, he can roll over before sender disables it. 

## Impact
Loan can be opened on terms different from the ones lender expects

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Option 1: Allow to configure `rollable` when creating loans
```solidity
function clear (uint256 reqID, bool rollable) external returns (uint256 loanID)
```
Option 2: Disallow rolling for loans that are far from expiry
