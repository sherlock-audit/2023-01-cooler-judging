# The borrower can call roll() before lenders toggleRoll() call.

## Summary
When lender uses clear(), the loan is created with bool rollable == true. If the lender doesn't want his lend to be rollable, the lender must call toggleRoll(). But when the borrower sees the loan cleared, the borrower can immediately call roll().
## Vulnerability Detail
The borrower can call roll() before lenders toggleRoll() call.
## Impact
Bad conditions for lenders.
