# Lenders can lose exposure to their assets for much more time than expected

## Summary
Lenders can lose exposure to their assets due to the owner being able to `roll` loans multiple times, thus greatly increasing loan's duration beyond the lender's expectations.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lenders are highly likely to make lending decisions based on the duration of a loan, as it greatly impacts the profitability of lending. 

When a request is `clear`-ed, `Loan.rollable` is set to `true`, without the lender's confirmation, thus allowing the owner to increase the loan's duration as much as he wants. This will result in the lender losing exposure to the `debt` assets.

Filename: src/Cooler.sol
```solidity
176:        loans.push(
177:            Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
178:        );
```

While contract-based lenders can immediately call `toggleRoll` after `clear` as a remedy, EOA's `toggleRoll` calls are susceptible to frontrunning by the owner's `roll` call. If the owner is a contract, it can do multiple `roll` calls in the single transaction that frontuns the lender's call.

This vulnerability remains even if `Loan.rollable` is set to false by default when `clear`-ing, if `toggleRoll` is called afterward.

## Impact
Lenders lose exposure to their assets, for as much time as owner wants

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the value set as `Loan.rollable` a parameter in `clear` function.

Also, allow lenders to set a max duration for the loans when calling `clear`, which cannot be exceeded by `roll`-ing.
