# Factory.sol: Collateral-Debt pair arrays can be spammed and DOS on-chain contracts

## Summary
The `Factory.sol` contract provides Collateral-Debt pair arrays where all coolers with a given Collateral-Debt pair are saved.

These arrays can be spammed which can lead to DOS in any on-chain contracts that read from any of these arrays.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can create a cooler with any collateral-debt pair:

An attacker can use different `msg.sender`s to create many coolers for a collateral-debt pair such that any contract that iterates over the array reverts or incurs massive gas costs.

## Impact
DOS contracts that read from collateral-debt pair arrays.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be no arrays that anyone can add elements to and that are iterated over by other contracts.
