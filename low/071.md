# Possible re-entrancy attack in request function

## Summary
Possible re-entrancy attack in the request function

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can re-enter in the "request" function by modifying the transferFrom function of the token used as a collateral;

## Impact
Alice can create a Cooler and push a lending request using Token A as collateral. 

In the transferFrom function of Token A, Alice introduced a line of code so when the Cooler calls this function, will re-enter and create two requests: request 1: 0 collateral tokens deposited; request 2: proper amount of collateral deposited;

If we will have a lender that wants to clear request 0, he will send the debt tokens to Alice, but Alice's collateral tokens are not in the Cooler smart contract so she can walk away with the money.

## Recommendation
Make the token transfer before modifying states and push the request
