# Overseer role may be accidentally sent to an operator

## Summary

Overseer role may be accidentally sent to an operator


## Vulnerability Detail

If an address currently is both the `operator` and the `overseer`, any attempt to transfer the `operator` role to another address will actually send the `overseer` role instead. Only after the roles have split, will an `operator` be able to be assigned.


## Impact

The `overseer` role has greater control of treasury funds, and the `operator` may not be trusted enough to even temporarily have this role, because they may be too tempted to steal the treasury funds. 


## Code Snippet

There is no way to specify which role is being pushed - `overseer` is always chosen first if it is the `msg.sender`:
```solidity
// File: src/aux/ClearingHouse.sol : ClearingHouse.push()   #1

118        function push (address newAddress) external {
119 @>         if (msg.sender == overseer) 
120                pendingOverseer = newAddress;
121            else if (msg.sender == operator) 
122                pendingOperator = newAddress;
123            else revert OnlyApproved();
124:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Have a flag saying whether the role to be pushed is the overseer or the operator role

The documentation says:
`Note that, because both roles share the same functions, small issues (though easily surmountable) may arise if the same address is set as both Overseer and Operator. However, this should not be done in the first place. Thus, because it is unlikely to occur, and it is recoverable even should it occur, this is not an area of concern.`

But if it should not be done, this should be enforced on-chain
