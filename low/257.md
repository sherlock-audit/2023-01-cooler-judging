# Voting reward cannot be withdrawn by owner

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L151

## Vulnerability Detail
Cooler allows owner to delegate voting power to another address if collateral is a voting token has `delegate()` function. 

Normally, DAO will has some reward for voters and it will be distributed to Cooler smart contract address. However, there is no function to claim this reward for owner.

## Impact
Voting reward is locked in Cooler forever

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function delegate (address to) external { 
  // @audit owner cannot withdraw voting reward
    if (msg.sender != owner) 
        revert OnlyApproved();
    IDelegateERC20(address(collateral)).delegate(to);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adding function allowing owner to withdraw excess amount of collateral.
