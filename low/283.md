# LOCK PRAGMAS TO SPECIFIC COMPILER VERSION

## Summary

All the Contracts have used Floating Pragma solidity Versions.

## Vulnerability Detail

Pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile locally.
