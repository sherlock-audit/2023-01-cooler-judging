# Insecure delegation security suggestions

## Summary

Insecure delegation security suggestions enabling loss of funds due to upgrades


## Vulnerability Detail

Normally the assumption is that maliciously-crafted tokens are out of scope, but in this case, the documentation specifically says:
`It is up to the lender to ensure that they are writing loans against good collateral. A simple suggestion is to check that the delegate() function on the collateral token does not, for example, transfer the tokens to the 'to' address.`
https://ag0.gitbook.io/cooler-loan-code-walkthrough/borrower-flow


## Impact

The advice of checking the `delegate()` function is not sufficient, because the token may also be upgradeable, and the upgrade may change the delegation function to thereafter be malicious. A user will believe they're safe and will interact with a collateral that they should not.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.delegate()   #1

151        function delegate (address to) external {
152            if (msg.sender != owner) 
153                revert OnlyApproved();
154 @>         IDelegateERC20(address(collateral)).delegate(to);
155:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

There is no way to protect against a malicious upgrade, but one can protect against currently-malicious code by checking the balance of the debt and collateral tokens before and after the `delegate()` call, and `require()` that the two pairs of balances are equal.
