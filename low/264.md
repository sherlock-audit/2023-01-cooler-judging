# Using the same address for the `overseer` and `operator` roles causes issues when changing roles

## Summary

If `overseer` and `operator` are desired to be the same address, changing the roles requires using a different address first.

## Vulnerability Detail

Pushing the `operator` role (i.e., setting `pendingOperator` to a new address `newAddress`) while `overseer` and `operator` are the same address will not work unless `overseer` is first set to another different address.

This is because `push()` will only set `pendingOperator` if the first `if` evaluates `msg.sender == overseer` as `false`.

## Impact

Pushing/changing the `operator` role to a different address will not work until `overseer` is first set to another address. This could cause operational issues.

## Code Snippet

[aux/ClearingHouse.sol#L118-L135](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/aux/ClearingHouse.sol#L118-L135)

```solidity
function push (address newAddress) external {
    if (msg.sender == overseer)
        pendingOverseer = newAddress;
    else if (msg.sender == operator)
        pendingOperator = newAddress;
    else revert OnlyApproved();
}

/// @notice new operator or overseer can pull role once pushed
function pull () external {
    if (msg.sender == pendingOverseer) {
        overseer = pendingOverseer;
        pendingOverseer = address(0);
    } else if (msg.sender == pendingOperator) {
        operator = pendingOperator;
        pendingOperator = address(0);
    } else revert OnlyApproved();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using a different mechanism to push/pull roles. For example, use a function parameter to specify the role to be pushed/pulled or use separate functions.
