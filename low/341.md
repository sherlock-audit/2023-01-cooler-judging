# request should be made only by the owner

## Summary

request should be made only by the owner. current implementation allows anyone to raise a loan request by depositing the collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function request (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interest,
        uint256 loanToCollateral,
        uint256 duration
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
        requests.push(
            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
        );
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
    }

request function is used to request for a fresh loan.

the business logic is implemented such that only the owner can repay and cancel the loans request.

Even for repaying , owner can close their loan. 

but the request call can be made by anyone. if do so, they would losse their collater which locks inside the contract

## Impact

others who raise request would loss their collateral
