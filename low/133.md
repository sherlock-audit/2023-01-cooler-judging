# Anyone can make a request on a cooler but loan and collateral always go to the owner

## Summary
Anyone can make a request on anyone cooler. however the `rescind()` function will always send collateral back to the owner of the cooler not the user that makes the request. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Although this is acknowledged in the docs as OK because the person might be an affiliate of the owner or being philanthropic. In practicality it is much more likely that the someone would make a request to another cooler not knowing of how the code actually works. 
For example:
Alice sees a cooler (Bob's cooler) for eth/dai
Alice would like to borrow some eth so she makes a request for 1 eth and puts up 2000 dai as collateral. 
Bob sees that someone made a request on his cooler and immediately calls `rescind()`. 
Bob receives all of Alice's collateral. 



## Impact
Users unaware of how the code works could loose all transferred funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The "philanthropy" feature ideally should be removed or have some safeguards. 
The "affiliate" feature should have a whitelist allowing certain users to make request on the behalf of the owner something like the below would suffice.
        `mapping(address => bool) canMakerequest;`
