# Full file imports

## Summary 

All files in scope import full files and can end up in duplicated imports. 

## Vulnerability Detail

For example, `CoolerFactory.sol` imports the following:

```solidity
import "./Cooler.sol";
import "./lib/ERC20.sol";
```

And the `Cooler.sol` imports:

```solidity
import "./lib/mininterfaces.sol";
import "./Factory.sol";
```
where `mininterfaces.sol` has also an `import "./ERC20.sol";`

## Impact

Importing full files can result in solc complaining about duplicate definitions and slither erroring, especially as repos grow and have more dependencies with overlapping names.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Always use named import syntax, don't import full files. This restricts what is being imported to just the named items, not everything in the file. Example:

```solidity
import {CoolerFactory, ERC20} from "./Factory.sol";
import {IDelegateERC20, ITreasury} from "../lib/mininterfaces.sol";
```
