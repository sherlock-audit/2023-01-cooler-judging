# Absence of address checks that whether borrow token and debt token are same or not

## Summary
Due to this absence  of check a Escrow contract can be created with same token address as debt and borrow token. So
There should be a address token address check where it ensure that both borrow token and debt token are different address.

## Vulnerability Detail
while creating a new Escrow contract for collateral and debt tokens from ```Factory``` there is absence of checks whether both tokens address that are passed are same or not
```solidity
function generate (ERC20 collateral, ERC20 debt) external returns (address cooler) {
        // Return address if cooler exists
        cooler = coolerFor[msg.sender][collateral][debt];

        // Otherwise generate new cooler
        if (cooler == address(0)) {
            cooler = address(new Cooler(msg.sender, collateral, debt));
            coolerFor[msg.sender][collateral][debt] = cooler;
            coolersFor[collateral][debt].push(cooler);
            created[cooler] = true;
        }
    }
```
Due to this absence  of check a Escrow contract can be created with same token address as debt and borrow token.

## Impact
Due to this absence  of check a Escrow contract can be created with same token address as debt and borrow token.
