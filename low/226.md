# Non-ERC777 transfer hooks can be used to prevent payments

## Summary

Non-ERC777 transfer hooks can be used to prevent payments

 
## Vulnerability Detail

ERC777 tokens are only one type of token that has transfer hooks. Any token can have such hooks. A malicious lender can use the transfer hook to execute arbitrary actions during repayment. 


## Impact

The owner can make their transfer hook always revert when tokens are sent from the borrower, causing payments to not go through, eventually triggering a default


## Code Snippet

Loan repayment would trigger the owner's collateral transfer hook:
```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.repay()   #1

113            
114            uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
115    
116            if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
117            else {
118                loan.amount -= repaid;
119                loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
120            }
121    
122            debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
123 @>         collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
124:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Change to a pull-model, where the funds are sent to the cooler, and then the `owner` must call a separate function to retrieve the funds

Because the documentation says that users that interact with `Cooler`s need to inspect the contract for vulnerabilities, they should check for transfer hooks too
