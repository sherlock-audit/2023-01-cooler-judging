# gjaldon - Lender can get an instantly defaulting loan

## Summary
If Cooler owner makes a `request` with 0 duration, a lender can `clear` this loan and call `defaulted` within one transaction immediately seizing the owner's collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since there is no check done on the `duration` parameter in `request`, this can be 0 or a very low value. User error can lead to the owner creating a loan `request` with 0 `duration`. If owner does not realize their mistake and just leaves the loan request out there for a lender to `clear` it, any lender can `clear` the loan and `defaulted` it within one transaction. 

## Impact
This is leads to loss of funds for the owner. Possibly high-risk due to the fact that the cost of the attack is cheap.

## Recommendation
Add validation in `request` before creating the `Request` struct ensuring that the duration is a minimum of 1 month or some other reasonable duration.
