# External party can fill `Cooler.requests` collection with bad data, making it hard for lenders to discover borrower's requests

## Summary
Anyone can use `request` function to create a lot of 0-amount requests for a cooler and fill requests array with irrelevant data.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Cooler.requests` is a public array that can be used by the front-end to discover cooler requests. However, the `request` function is unrestricted and also lacks validation so an external party can create a bunch of requests with 0 amount, making `requests` collection bloated. This attack would only cost gas.

There are several ways for lenders to discover requests:
- Using `requests` array - this can be broken using the described method
- Using `Request` event - can be DoS'd in the same manner as events don't contain info about who created a cooler or requested amount
- Using reqID returned from `request` function - this way borrowers will have to store and manage request IDs themselves and then push it to the front-end

## Impact
Low as it will still be possible to use the protocol by managing reqID values, so it's not a total DoS. Also the attack costs gas for the malicious party.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Consider minimal amount for requests
2. Add `uint indexed amount` to `Request` event to simplify discovering interesting requests for lenders
