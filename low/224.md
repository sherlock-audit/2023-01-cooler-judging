# Blocklisted P2P `Cooler` owners cannot get their collateral

## Summary

Blocklisted P2P `Cooler` owners cannot get their collateral


## Vulnerability Detail

There is no way to transfer the ownership of a cooler to another address


## Impact

If a P2P `Cooler`'s owner becomes blocklisted for their collateral, they'll never be able to retrieve their collateral or make loan payments, and will be forced to default


## Code Snippet

```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.repay()   #1

122            debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
123:@>         collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
```

```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.rescind()   #2

101            req.active = false;
102:@>         collateral.transfer(owner, collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Allow the `owner` to be changed, as is possible with the `loan.lender`
