# Lack of two-step procedure and zero checks for critical operation

## Summary
Several functions have this problem and is extremely important to the security of contracts. However there is lack of zero address check and lack of 2 step address changing.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lack of 0-address check for push function.
Also I recommend to make changing address process into 2-step process to avoid accidently setting controller to wrong address.

## Impact
```solidity
ClearingHouse.sol:

function push (address newAddress) external {
        if (msg.sender == overseer) 
            pendingOverseer = newAddress;
        else if (msg.sender == operator) 
            pendingOperator = newAddress;
        else revert OnlyApproved();
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
**Short term:** add zero address check for `push()` function and use a two-step procedure for all non-recoverable critical operations to prevent irrecoverable mistakes. 
**Long term:** identify and document all possible actions and their associated risks for privileged accounts. Identifying the risks will assist codebase review and prevent future mistakes.
