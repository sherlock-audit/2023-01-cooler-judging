# `CoolerFactory`'s coolersFor can grow really large and get unusable

## Summary
When more users start using the protocol, `coolersFor[collateral][debt]` arrays will grow a lot, making them not feasible to be used on the front-end.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the docs, `coolersFor` property is supposed to be used on the front-end to display coolers for collateral/debt pairs. The following [page](https://ag0.gitbook.io/cooler-loan-code-walkthrough/borrower-flow) says:
> Finally, we push the cooler address to our 'coolersFor' public mapping (used for front end purposes), and mark down that the factory created this address (used for verification purposes). 

Let's way we have 60k users using the protocol for DAI/gOHM pair. That will be the length of coolersFor[daiAddress][gOHMAddress] array. This is too large to be queried for the front-end. I recommend using indexed events and a back-end service to keep track of coolers.

## Impact
Low as it doesn't affect user funds. However, it may cause scaling issues for the front-end which will affect protocol negatively.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Emit events when coolers are created:
```solidity
event CoolerCreated(address indexed owner, address indexed debt, address indexed collateral);
```
In `CoolerFactory.generate`:
```solidity
emit CoolerCreated(msg.sender, debt, collateral)
```
The events can then be captured via subgraph/other solutions
