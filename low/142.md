# User that posses both rolls will never be able to push a new operator safely.

## Summary
 User that posses both rolls will never be able to push a new operator safely. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `push()` function in `Clearinghouse.sol` if the user posses both roles they will always enter the first if statement. and never have access to the else if statement. 

This will mean that the overseer/operator will never be able to assign a new address to operator. Unless they also get rid of their overseer role.

## Impact
Key functionality is broken and User that posses both rolls will never be able to push a new operator safely. 

Not only that but if a user is unaware of this (which they most likely would be) when they try and give the operator role to someone else they will actually be giving the overseer role instead.

In short: key functionality is broken resulting in a unintended ownership changes. And never being able to safely push a new operator.

## Recommendation
Create separate function for each role if a user is allowed to obtain multiple roles.
