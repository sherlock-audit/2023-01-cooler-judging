# The protocol allows a limited number of users to request loans

## Summary
The protocol allows a limited number of users to request loans

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
According to the documentation: We can assume that a third party creating a request for another borrower is either due to affiliation or philanthropy. Both are just fine.

That means if Person A creates an Eth/Usdt pool, only Person A should be able to request a loan (call the "request" function).

This thing can be bad for the protocol because let's say we have a Person B that wants to request a loan from the Eth/Usdt pool. Person B can't create a new pool.

## Recommendation
Allow other people to request loans from a pool and change the logic of the smart contract
