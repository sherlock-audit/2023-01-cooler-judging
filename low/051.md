# Poor Contract Architecture can lead to unexpected behavior

## Summary

In `Cooler` contract, `CoolerFactory` contract has been imported and its instance has been created and used. Likewise In `CoolerFactory` contract too, `Cooler` contract has been imported and its instance has been used.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue with this design is that both the contract will have more than 1 instance of the same code.

## Impact

This multiple contracts with same name leads to Collision in Code which can lead to unexpected behavior in future.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: src/Cooler.sol

5:      import "./Factory.sol";

```

## Tool used

Surya Graph + Manual Review

Surya Graph clearly showed redundent dependencies.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to linearized the dependency graph so that it can avoid collision and contracts get imported exactly once.

Best way to achieve this will be:

1. As in `Cooler` contract, `CoolerFactory` is used only for emitting events, we can remove `CoolerFactory` import and instance of it.
2. Instead shift the events [`Request`, `Rescind` and `Clear`] from `CoolerFactory` to `Cooler` contract and directly call them in place of calling them through `CoolerFactory`.

This can linearize the dependency graph and prevent code collisions.
