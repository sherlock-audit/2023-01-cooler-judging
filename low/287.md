# Wrong decimals can cause calc problems

## Summary

Wrong decimals can cause calc problems

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens, like USDT, has just 6 decimals, however 18 decimals is hardcoded in the contract. 

## Impact

It can bring problems in calculations where decimals are used, like interestFor() and collaateralFor(). Users that will use tokens with 6,12, 20 decimals tokens can get more or less in transfers.

## Recommendation

Instead of hardcoded variable with decimals, it's better to check it with token.decimals() functions.
