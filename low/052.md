# ClearingHouse: parameter bounds should be mutable

## Summary
The `ClearingHouse` contract defines the following parameter bounds:

Loans that are not within these bounds cannot be cleared via the `ClearingHouse.clear` function:

These parameters might make sense at some point in time not at a later time.

## Vulnerability Detail
For example, it might make sense to have a minimum interest rate of 2% at some point. However market conditions might change such that nobody will take a loan with 2% interest per year.
That it would be required to lower the minimum interest rate to keep the `ClearingHouse` contract operable.

## Impact
When market conditions change, the `ClearingHouse` becomes inoperable because the parameter bounds cannot be changed.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I suggest making the parameters bounds mutable such that the `overseer` can set them.
