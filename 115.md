# Not validating transfer and transferFrom could lead to loss of funds

## Summary

Some ERC20 tokens such as ZRX  return a boolean from the `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods. Making it possible to create a request without transferring the tokens to contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a vault is created with `ZRX` token as collateral and `WETH` as debt, ZRX token can fail the transfer and still create the request, making it possible for a lender to add WETH as debit but doesn't receive any token if defaulted.

Another example, it would be possible for a borrower to create and rescind the request to withdraw all `ZRX` tokens from the contract

## Impact

Loss of funds from contract or lender

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L85

```solidity
collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L102

```solidity
collateral.transfer(owner, collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L122-L123

```solidity
debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L146

```solidity
collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L179

```solidity
debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L205

```solidity
collateral.transfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` methods of OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library instead of `transfer` and `transferFrom`

```diff
- token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _value);
+ token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _value);

- token.transfer(msg.sender, value);
+ token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, value);
```
