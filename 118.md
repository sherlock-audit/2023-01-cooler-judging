# Protocol does not support fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens

## Summary

The protocol uses a non-specific ERC20 underlying in its constructor. This ERC20 underlying may be a fee-on-transfer token, which will result in accounting error and less interest paid.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol uses a non-specific ERC20 underlying in its constructor. This ERC20 underlying may be a fee-on-transfer token. Some fee on transfer tokens, do not reduce the fee directly from the transferred amount, but subtracts it from remaining balance of sender. Some tokens prefer this approach, to make the amount received by the recipient an exact amount. Therefore, after funds are send to users, balance becomes less than it should be.

For example, in Cooler.interestFor(), the calculated interest only refers to the borrowed amount, and not the total amount with fee / rebasing. If interestFor is called and there is a 1% fee-on-transfer, the borrower has to fork out the additional loan for the fee, instead of paying 99% of the ideal borrowed amount, which incurs more fee. Conversely, if the token is a rebasing token, then the borrower should pay less than the borrowed amount because of the increased collateral per day.

```solidity
    function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
        return amount * interest / decimals;
    }
```
## Impact

The fixed interest paid may not be calculated correctly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount.
