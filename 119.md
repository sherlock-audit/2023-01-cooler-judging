# Possibility of leave amount of collateral in while repaying

## Summary

While repaying a loan is possible to not withdraw any collateral and leave this collateral stuck in the contract forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

Given example:

1. `Cooler` contract with WETH as collateral and USDC as debt
2. Borrower creates a request:

```solidity
{
	amount: 500_000 * (10**18), //500k WETH
	interest: 0.02 * (10**18), //2%
	loanToCollateral: 1 * (10**18), //1 USDC collateral = 1 WETH
	duration: 1 years,
}
```

1. If the borrower wants to repay the loan with a value < 1 * (10**12):

```solidity
//collateral: 500_000 * (10*6) - 500k USDC for 500k WETH
//repaid: 1 * (10**11)
//amount: 502_500 * (10**18)
uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
```

1. In this case the decollateralized value is `0`.
2. Then the collateral is reduced by 0 and the loan amount is reduced by 1 * (10**11)
3. Making it possible to pay the loan and left the collateral inside the contract

## Impact

This issue is considered a Medium because the borrower will need to run in a loop to repay the loan and leave the collateral, but if by mistake he runs once he will lose a small percentage of tokens

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L108-L124

```solidity
function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
  Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

  if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
    revert Default();
  
  uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

  if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
  else {
    loan.amount -= repaid;
    loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
  }

  debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
  collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if the `decollateralized` variable is different from 0 to finish repaying the loan

```diff
uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
+ if(decollateralized == 0) revert InvalidRepay();
```
