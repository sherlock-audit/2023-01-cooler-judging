# Inadequate Access Control in "rescind()" Function


everyone can burn reqs because it doesn't check correctly the owner of req, and who can burn the reqs 

Impact:everybody can burn others' req 

snippet: 
```
    function rescind (uint256 reqID) external {
        if (msg.sender != owner) 
            revert OnlyApproved();

        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Rescind);

        Request storage req = requests[reqID];

        if (!req.active)
            revert Deactivated();
        
        req.active = false;
        collateral.transfer(owner, collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
    }
```
recommendation: check correctly who can decide the reqs
