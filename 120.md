# The coolersFor mapping in Factory.sol can potentially exceed gas limit because of a lack of upper bound, which leads to DoS of protocol

## Summary

An attacker can potentially create many Cooler open loans through the factory, resulting in DoS of protocol 

## Vulnerability Detail

In Factory.sol, when a Cooler (Open Loan) is created, the open loan is stored in the  coolersFor[collateral][debt] array 

```solidity
    mapping(ERC20 => mapping(ERC20 => address[])) public coolersFor;
    .
    .  
    .
    function generate (ERC20 collateral, ERC20 debt) external returns (address cooler) {
    .
    .
    coolerFor[msg.sender][collateral][debt] = cooler;
    coolersFor[collateral][debt].push(cooler);
    created[cooler] = true;
```

This address array is never deleted, so every time a cooler is created, a new array will be pushed into the address array. An attacker can create numerous Escrow contract for collateral and debt tokens and call generate() to increase the length of the array. Since there are more than 450,000 ERC20 contracts, one collateral can be potentially matched with 450,000 ERC20 contracts. 

## Impact

DoS of protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an option to remove the collateral pair if there is no open loans with that pair, or limit the number of pairs available, or have the governance remove the pair if any token is compromised.
