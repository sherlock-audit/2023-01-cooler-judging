# Lender can roll the loan to increase the debt for borrower, and force the borrower pay more

## Summary
Function `roll` in contract Cooler.sol is used to extend the loan at origination terms. But there is no restriction about who can roll the loan. So the lender can roll his/her loan and increase the loan's amount to make borrower pay more than he expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume that user A are using USDC as collateral to borrow ETH from user B. One day, the price of ETH increases dramatically, user B calls function `Cooler.roll()` to roll the loan. There will be 2 possible case happen: 
* **Case 1:** user A repays all the debt
==> user B will make profit here since the price of ETH increases compare to the initial price `loanToCollateral` and user B just needs to transfer amount of `collateral` correspond to the old price in function `roll()`
* **Case 2:** user A doesn't repay the debt. 
==> user B will lose nothing since the collateral he transfers in function `roll()` would be transferred back to him when calling function `defaulted()` at expiry time

## Impact
The lender can manipulate his/her loan as they want, force the borrower to pay more / losse the collateral. There is no way for the borrower to prevent it.
