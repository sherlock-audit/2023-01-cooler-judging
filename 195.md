# Unsafe usage of ERC20 .transfer() and .transferFrom()

## Summary
The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
Using unsafe ERC20 methods can revert the transaction for certain tokens.

## Impact
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L102
```solidity
ClearingHouse.sol:
111: token.transfer(treasury, amount);

Cooler.sol
85: collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
102: collateral.transfer(owner, collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
122: debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
123: collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
146: collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
179: debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
