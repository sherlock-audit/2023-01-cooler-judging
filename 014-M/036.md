# Loss of precision resulting in wrong calculation of interest

## Summary
In `Cooler.sol` , the contract uses interestFor function to compute the interest cost on requested debt of the borrower, due to precision loss the lender will end up getting less amount than the promised. 

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
        return amount * interest / decimals;
    }
```
In the above interest calculation, its performing [division over multiplication](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#divide-before-multiply) first. So for any value of rate and duration which satisfy the `` rate * duration < 31,536,000 `` the lender will end up getting less than the promised amount.

## Impact
loss of funds of lender

## Recommendation
```solidity
    function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * rate * duration / (decimals * 365 days);
    }
```
