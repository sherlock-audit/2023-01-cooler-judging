# Loss of precision leads to wrong result

## Summary
Loss of precision leads to wrong result in `interestFor` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/// @param amount of debt tokens
    /// @param rate of interest (annualized)
    /// @param duration of loan in seconds
    /// @return interest as a number of debt tokens
    function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
        return amount * interest / decimals;
    }
```
As we can see in the function `interestFor` the interest is calculated and then multiplied by the amount, this makes the function behave like this:
 ```solidity
return amount * (rate * duration / 365 days) / decimals;
```
this means the division is done before the multiplication, and so loss of precision.
## Impact
As mentioned the impact of this vulnerability is the return of wrong results in `interestFor` function .
For Example:
If we call this function with these parameters: `interestFor(10000000000000000000,67,10000000)` it will return `210`
while if we fixed it like this:
```solidity
        function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
            return (amount * rate * duration / 365 days) / decimals;
    }
```
the function will return `212`
## Code Snippet
```solidity
/// @param amount of debt tokens
    /// @param rate of interest (annualized)
    /// @param duration of loan in seconds
    /// @return interest as a number of debt tokens
    function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
        return amount * interest / decimals;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Rewrite the function like this:
```solidity
        function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
            return (amount * rate * duration / 365 days) / decimals;
    }
```
