# `interestFor` return smaller values for some amounts

## Summary

Solidity integer division might truncate. 

## Vulnerability Details

Performing first a division and later a multiplication can create significant loss of precision. When this happens on a value related to assets or fees it becomes dangerous

## Impact

Loss of interest amount / assets returned later due to precision

## Code Snippet

Lack of precision due to the order of operations may truncate value later used in asset calculation at [roll](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L140) and [clear](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L171), doing that for values lower than `31536000`, interest will be smaller 

```solidity
uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
return amount * interest / decimals; 
```

This is later used in `roll()`

```solidity
uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);

loan.amount += newDebt;
```

In `clear()`

```solidity
uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral);
uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;

loanID = loans.length;
loans.push(
    Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
);
```

## Tool used

Manual analysis

## Recommendation

Reorder the operations. a / b * c / d can be ordered as (a * c) / (b * d)

Such as:

```diff
- uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
- return amount * interest / decimals; 
+ uint256 interest = rate * duration;
+ return (amount * interest) / (decimals * 365 days); 
```
