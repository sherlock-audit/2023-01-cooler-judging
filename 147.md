# If their is bot that is clearing the loans and not realizing erc20 reentrancy,an attacker can steal funds and get loans with out putting up collateral

## Summary
Let's say   the `operator` or the lender  is a bot and   when a loan  is requested, the bot fills it but what happens if it's an erc20 token  that on `transferFrom`  you can reenter and still make a loan request without paying collateral 
## Vulnerability Detail
ex:
let's say the operator/lender is a bot and the `collateral` token is an erc20 you can reenter.
1. an attacker calls `request` for a loan of 100 dai and gives 50 tokens of collateral and then the attacker reenters and specifies a 0 amount of collateral and makes a request not to give collateral.
2. The bot sees the request and doesn't check the collateral was transferred because of the assumption in the code that when someone makes a request they give collateral no matter what.  
3. The loan is cleared 
4. Attacker gets debt but  since there is no collateral  the lender cant get funds 
## Impact
Lenders losses funds 
Since it's not the lender's fault because in the spec any coin is supposed to transfer collateral.
If the gOHM token is updated and has `call`  in the `transferFrom` function that can cause a serious loss of funds
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        reqID = requests.length;
        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
        requests.push(
            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
        );
        collateral.transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral)
        );

//defaulted function
        collateral.transfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
```

## Recommendation
Make the functions in the contract have a non reenter modifier
