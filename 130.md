# Use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() for ERC20 transfers

## Summary
Cooler contest states 'any ERC20 supported', therefore it should take into account all the different ways of signalling success and failure. This is not the case, as all ERC20's transfer(), transferFrom(), and approve() functions are either not verified at all or verified for returning true. As a result, depending on the ERC20 token, some transfer errors may result in passing unnoticed, and/or some successfull transfer may be treated as failed.



## Vulnerability Detail

Currently the only supported ERC20 tokens are the ones that fulfill both the following requirements:

always revert on failure;
always returns boolean true on success.
An example of a very well known token that is not supported is Tether USD (USDT)

Tokens have different ways of signalling success and failure, and this affect mostly transfer(), transferFrom() and approve() in ERC20 tokens. While some tokens revert upon failure, others consistently return boolean flags to indicate success or failure, and many others have mixed behaviours.

See below a snippet of the [USDT Token contract (https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L1) compared to the 0x's [ZRX Token contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L1) where the USDT Token transfer function does not even return a boolean value, while the ZRX token consistently returns boolean value hence returning false on failure instead of reverting.


USDT Token snippet (no return value) ;
```js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(3 * 32) {
	var _allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender];

	// Check is not needed because sub(_allowance, _value) will already throw if this condition is not met
	// if (_value > _allowance) throw;

	uint fee = (_value.mul(basisPointsRate)).div(10000);
	if (fee > maximumFee) {
		fee = maximumFee;
	}
	if (_allowance < MAX_UINT) {
		allowed[_from][msg.sender] = _allowance.sub(_value);
	}
	uint sendAmount = _value.sub(fee);
	balances[_from] = balances[_from].sub(_value);
	balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(sendAmount);
	if (fee > 0) {
		balances[owner] = balances[owner].add(fee);
		Transfer(_from, owner, fee);
	}
	Transfer(_from, _to, sendAmount);
}
```

## Code Snippet

```js
src/Cooler.sol:
  107      /// @param repaid debt tokens to repay
  108:     function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
  109:         Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
  110: 
  111:         if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
  112:             revert Default();
  113:         
  114:         uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
  115: 
  116:         if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
  117:         else {
  118:             loan.amount -= repaid;
  119:             loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
  120:         }
  121: 
  122:         debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
  123:         collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
  124:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the SafeERC20 library implementation from OpenZeppelin and call safeTransferFrom when transferring ERC20 tokens.
