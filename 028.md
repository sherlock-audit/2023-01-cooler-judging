# Cooler: repay function can be front-run so borrowers transaction reverts

## Summary
The `Cooler.repay` function is used to repay a loan.
An attacker can call this function with a very small amount and front-run the borrower's transaction to fully repay the loan.
Thereby the borrower's transaction reverts because `loan.amount -= repaid` underflows:

## Impact
An attacker can DOS transactions of users that try to repay the full loan.

Only allow the borrower to repay his loan or if `repaid > loan.amount` then only transfer `loan.amount`:  `debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, loan.amount);`
