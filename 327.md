# repay business logic should handle the case if the repaid amount is greater than loan amount.

## Summary

In cooler contract, there is a business logic implemented where the borrower or anyone can repay the loan either partically or fully.

but in one scenario, the repaid amount can be greater then the loan amount. in this case, the contract reverts which would be  a loss to imo. The borrower can change the mind and come back to repay again which could not be sure if they change their mindset.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];


        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();
        
        uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;


        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
        else {
            loan.amount -= repaid;
            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
        }


        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
    }

in above if statement `if (repaid == loan.amount) ` if the repaid > loan.amount, then the else part is executed where the transaction will revert due to underflow.

## Impact

Repayment could be postponed or skipped if the borrower change their mindset.

## Recommendation

Update the logic as shown below.

        function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];


        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();

      + if (repaid >=  loan.amount)--------------updated
      +    repaid = loan.amount;------------------updated
        
        uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;


        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
        else {
            loan.amount -= repaid;
            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
        }


        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
    }
