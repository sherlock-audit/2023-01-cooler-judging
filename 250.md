# Recommended Whitelisting For Collateral And Debt Tokens

## Summary

Users can create the `Cooler` as their escrow contract in the Cooler protocol. **Users can freely register any tokens as collateral and debt tokens for their loans.** However, the protocol was designed and implemented to deal with only standard ERC-20 tokens. 

**Suppose some weird tokens, such as *FEE-ON-TRANSFER tokens*, *REBASING tokens*, or *MALICIOUS tokens*, are registered. The Cooler protocol could operate on the weird tokens incorrectly, leading to possible exploitable scenarios.**

## Vulnerability Detail

The Cooler protocol was designed and implemented for utilizing only standard ERC-20 tokens as collateral and debt tokens. Snippet 1 below presents the `CoolerFactory.generate()` function that allows users to generate the `Cooler` as their escrow contract. 

**I noticed that the `generate()` function does not implement a whitelist mechanism for permitted tokens. In other words, users can freely pair any collateral and debt tokens to generate their `Cooler` contract.**

**Suppose some weird tokens, such as *FEE-ON-TRANSFER tokens*, *REBASING tokens*, or *MALICIOUS tokens*, are registered as collateral or debt tokens. In that case, the weird tokens can make the protocol operate incorrectly, leading to possible exploitable scenarios.**

```solidity
SNIPPET: 1

LOCATIONS: L26 - L37

26:     function generate (ERC20 collateral, ERC20 debt) external returns (address cooler) {
27:         // Return address if cooler exists
28:         cooler = coolerFor[msg.sender][collateral][debt];
29: 
30:         // Otherwise generate new cooler
31:         if (cooler == address(0)) {
32:             cooler = address(new Cooler(msg.sender, collateral, debt));
33:             coolerFor[msg.sender][collateral][debt] = cooler;
34:             coolersFor[collateral][debt].push(cooler);
35:             created[cooler] = true;
36:         }
37:     }
```

For instance, snippet 2 shows the `Cooler.repay()` function that allows borrowers to repay loans and retrieve their collateral assets. **Assume that some *FEE-ON-TRANSFER token* is registered as the debt token.**

Once a borrower executes the `Cooler.repay()` function to repay the entire loan (100%). **The function expects the total debt asset amount (loan.amount) to be transferred back to the lender. Therefore, the function would calculate the `decollateralized` variable (L114) using that notion, `decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount`.**

Next, the `repay()` function would transfer the debt asset from the borrower to the lender (L122) and then transfer the total collateral asset (100%) back to the borrower (L123).

**Subsequently, the borrower would receive 100% collateral asset back. Nevertheless, the lender would receive some fee-deducted debt asset (since the debt asset is a *FEE-ON-TRANSFER token*).**

110:
111:        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
112:            revert Default();
113:        
114: *      uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
115:
116:        if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
117:        else {
118:            loan.amount -= repaid;
119:            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
120:        }
121:
122: *      debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
123: *      collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
124:    }
```

## Impact

The lack of the *token whitelist mechanism* of the Cooler protocol can lead to possible exploitable scenarios. As already explained in the `Vulnerability Detail` section, 
**some weird tokens, such as *FEE-ON-TRANSFER tokens*, *REBASING tokens*, or MALICIOUS tokens, can cause the protocol to operate incorrectly, directly affecting the assets of borrowers and lenders**.

For the likelihood of this vulnerability, I evaluate it as MEDIUM **(since any user can freely create their `Cooler` contract with arbitrary collateral-debt pair)**. 

For the impact on assets managed by the protocol, I rate it as HIGH **(registering weird tokens to the protocol can expose other attack vectors -- refer to the `Vulnerability Detail` section for one example of the possible exploitable scenarios)**. 

For this reason, the risk of this vulnerability is HIGH.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing a token whitelist mechanism to restrict only permitted ERC-20 tokens to be registered to the protocol. **The below snippet shows the improved version of the `CoolerFactory.generate()` function with the token whitelist mechanism (L27 - L28).**
