# Incorrect Collateral can be collected

## Summary
Borrower can call the `request` method with a very high value of loanToCollateral which reduces the collateral required against the loan amount. Thus collateral collected will be too less compared to loan amount

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume the genuine value for loanToCollateral should be 2500
2. But User creates a new request with loanToCollateral set as 5000
3. This means the collected collateral will be half of what was actually required

```solidity
function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
    }
```

4. If User defaults then lender receives the collateral which is 50% less than what was expected

## Impact
The collateral collected by contract will be too less due to high value of loanToCollateral. Thus on default, lender get these lesser funds giving loss

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use Oracle to get prices for collateral and debt token and automatically derive value of loanToCollateral instead of relying on user input
