# Rolling a loan with request terms

## Summary
When the loan is rolled over, it uses the current state of the loan, and the initial request terms are not accounted for.

## Vulnerability Detail
The comment above the function ```roll``` says it "_uses terms from request_":
```solidity
    /// @notice roll a loan over
    /// @notice uses terms from request
    /// @param loanID index of loan in loans[]
    function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
```
However, it actually uses the current state of the loan when calculating new collateral and debt:
```solidity
  uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
  uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
```
It takes ```loan.amount``` as an input for calculations, not ```loan.request.amount```. ```loan.amount``` can be lower than the initial request amount if the loan was partially repaid before:
```solidity
  function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
      ...
      else {
            loan.amount -= repaid;
            loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
        }
```

## Impact
The borrowers can partially repay the amount of the loan to lower the required amount to a suitable level before re-rolling it. Then they can enjoy this new amount with the same LTC ratio and duration terms as previously.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider if this is intended behavior or should be refactored to use the ```request.amount``` when calculating new collateral and debt upon rerolling the loan.
