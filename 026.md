# ClearingHouse.sol: Lack of zero address check for overseer and operator can lead to loss of control over contract

## Summary
The ClearingHouse has two special roles. The `operator` and the `overseer`.
They are set in the constructor:

However there is no zero address check.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the constructor the `operator` and `overseer` can be set to the zero address. This leads to loss of control over the contract because the contract requires for its operation that the two roles are set.

## Impact
Contract becomes inoperable.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check that `operator` and `overseer` are not the zero address.
When doing this it also makes sense to check for all other arguments to the constructor that they are not the zero address (`factory`, `gOHM`, `dai`, `treasury`).
