# Terms for expiry date for loans can be bypassed

## Summary
Lenders and borrowers come to an agreement via the contract based on the terms provided in a `Request`. The decided expiry date can unilaterally be extended by the borrower without any input from the lender.

## Vulnerability Detail
The key issue here is that the default state of `rollable` is set to true when a lender clears a loan. A loan that has been newly cleared can always be rolled. The borrower can always frontrun the `toggleRoll()` transaction and extend the expiry date of the loan regardless of whether lender agrees to it. In fact, borrower can make multiple transactions of `roll()` before `toggleRoll()` is called to extend the expiry date multiple times.

## Impact
Impact is severe here because lender essentially does not have a choice for the expriy date of a loan. The agreed upon expiry date can be extended even if they do not want to allow it. Borrower can choose to extend the expiry date to its own preference. 

For example, Borrower and Lender agrees on a loan of `1 years`. Right after Lender clears the loan, Borrower calls `toggleRoll()` 10 times, put in the required collateral to cover the interest and extend it by `10 years`. Lender is now forced to give a loan of `10 years` even though they `toggleRoll()`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that we set the default state of whether a loan is `rollable` to false when a loan is cleared by Lender.
