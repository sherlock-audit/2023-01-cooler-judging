# rollable defaults to true, which may put Lender at risk

## Summary
rollable defaults to trueï¼Œwhen interest=0, owner can extend borrowing time without cost,put Lender at risk

## Vulnerability Detail
The current borrowing process is
1.owner execute request
2.lender executes clear(), note that this default rollable=true
3. owner can execute roll() to extend the borrowing time
The normal situation is not a problem, because in step 3 to perform roll will have a cost, will be additional to add newDebt and newCollateral

But here there is a situation: interest = 0, step 3 is basically no cost, newCollateral = 0, newDebt = 0 (except for a little gas)

The following situation can put lender at risk:
Suppose:
owner = alice lender = bob

1. Alice generates request: amount = 1000usd, interest = 0 , duration = 1 month
2. alice persuades his acquaintance bob (not a very deep friend) whether it is possible to borrow 1000usd, 1 month to pay back, please rest assured that if there is no collateral is you.
3. bob thought only one month, he did not know the default rollable = true. one month is very short, it does not matter, not much risk.
4. bob call clear()
5. alice can immediately perform multiple roll() to costlessly increase the borrowing date to several years
6. bob in these years can only wait, it is possible that the collateral token has been devalued to not worth 2000usd

So I think the default rollable=true when the interest=0 is not reasonable
When interest>0 default rollable=true, but interest=0,rollable default rollable=false is more reasonable to avoid the above risk
If there is a need to reset  rollable=true via toggleRoll()

## Impact
owner maybe extend borrowing time without cost,put Lender at risk ( collateral token has been devalued to not worth debt token)
## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
...
        //*****@audit when interest =0, then newCollateral==0 and newDebt==0 
        uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);

        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.expiry += req.duration;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
    }
```

```solidity
    function clear (uint256 reqID) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
...
        loans.push(
            Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender) //***<---rollable ==true
        );
        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
rollable=false when the interest=0
```solidity
    function clear (uint256 reqID) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
...
        loans.push(
-           Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
+           Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, req.interest==0?false:true, msg.sender)
        );
        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);
    }
```
