# Borrower can roll a loan over several times in a row which may not be desirable for the lender

## Summary
Borrower can call `roll` several times in a row vastly increasing loan duration. There is no way to prevent it for the lender other than disabling rolling altogether.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown in the snippet section, in the `roll` function the only checks performed are whether the loan is rollable and not expired. That means borrower can `roll` many times in a row and significantly increase loan duration. This requires adding collateral but in many cases this may still be beneficial for the borrower and undesirable for the lender.

## Impact
Keeping rolling enabled is dangerous for the lenders and likely will not be used very often

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only allow rolling if loan is past certain percentage of the total duration. For example:
```solidity
    function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
        Request memory req = loan.request;

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();

        if (!loan.rollable)
            revert NotRollable();

        if (block.timestamp < loan.expiry - (req.duration / 2))
            revert("Can't roll over till loan is at 50% duration");
```
