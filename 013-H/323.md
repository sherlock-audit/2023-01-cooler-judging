# Roll multiple times on a loan to lock it for a long time

## Summary

Directly after a loan is cleared, anyone can call `roll(loanID)` on the Cooler any number of times they want. This will bump the loan expiry time a corresponding number of times multiplied by `request.duration` at the cost of collateral for the caller. The idea is to lock the loan in order for the lender to never be able to call `defaulted(loanID)` on it.

## Vulnerability Detail

With the example values provided in `ClearingHouse.sol` of `minimumInterest = 2%` and `maxDuration = 1 year`, it would cost about `21.9%` of the collateral to lock the loan for `10 additional years` or `48.6%` of the collateral to lock the loan for `20 additional years` with only 10 or 20 calls to `roll(loanID)` (due to compound interests).

Since any address can repay a loan, the attacker can lock a loan for 20 or more years and create a ransom contract that will repay the loan only if a ransom is paid out. The attacker would ask for the lender to repay `initial debt + interests of the locked duration + collateral cost of the attack + ransom` in order to repay the loan and receive `ransom` positive value from the attack. The lender would get all the `initial debt + interests of the locked duration` back, and the Cooler owner would receive `collateral cost of the attack`.

If the attacker is the borrower, they can ask for `initial debt + interests of the locked duration + ransom` since they will receive `collateral cost of the attack` back in the end.

## Impact

If attackers have access to sufficient collateral, they can borrow all the tokens available in the `ClearingHouse`Â contract, lock them for 20 or more years, and ask for a ransom. If the `ClearingHouse` does not have access to any more funds, this would render the `ClearingHouse` unusable. 

If the `ClearingHouse` owner accept to pay the ransom, they would lose funds. If not, both the attacker and `ClearingHouse` owner's funds are locked for a long period of time.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only allow for `roll(loanID)` to be called when the remaining time of the loan is below `25%` of its duration. Or only allow `roll(loanID)` to bump the `loan.expiry` time to `block.number + req.duration`. Or set the default `loan.rollable` to `false` and inform users of its implication.
