# Borrower can exploit `roll` method with frontrunning

## Summary

`clear` method uses default value `rollable` as true and `roll` function uses the `rollable` value as validation to extend the loan whose duration can be anything.

## Vulnerability Detail

By Frontrunning the `roll` method, Borrower can extend the `expiry` by whatever `duration` he/she wants.

## Impact

This situation can lead to Borrower getting extension for any duration which he/she sets without consent of the lender. Even if `lender` agrees for `roll`, Borrow can still exploits it by setting a very big value of extension of duration.

## Proof of Concept

Consider the following situation:

1. Alice after using `generate` method, `request` a loan.
2. Bob as a lender wants to give out loan. He does that using `clear` method.
3. Now the loan has been set with `rollable` value as `true` by default.
4. Bob wants to change it by using `toggleRoll`. But he will have to do it in different transaction.
5. Alice can Frontrun this transaction and call `roll` method and can extend `expiry` to whatever time he wants and Bob has no control over it.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: Cooler.sol

129:  function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
          Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
          Request memory req = loan.request;

          if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
              revert Default();

          if (!loan.rollable)
              revert NotRollable();

          uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
          uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);

          loan.amount += newDebt;
          loan.expiry += req.duration;
          loan.collateral += newCollateral;
          
          collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
147:  }

162:  function clear (uint256 reqID) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
          Request storage req = requests[reqID];

          factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Clear);

          if (!req.active) 
              revert Deactivated();
          else req.active = false;

          uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
          uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral);
          uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;

          loanID = loans.length;
          loans.push(
              Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
          );
          debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);
180:  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Mitigating this Vulnerability can be done in 2 ways:

1. Add an extra parameter where lender can set `rollable` value in `clear` method. If lender doesn't want the loan to be rolled, he/she can directly use `rollable` value as `false` in same transaction of releasing debt token. Now Borrower can no longer use frontrunning attack vector.
2. Add a delay in executing `roll` from the time it gets called first. This can give lender enough time to agree or not with loan getting rolled.

It is also recommended to add a Max duration value in the contract itself and only allow duration below that. This can prevent Borrower from exploiting the `roll` by giving very high duration even if `lender` is agree for rolling the loan with `rollable` true.
