# `ClearingHouse.maxDuration` can be easily bypassed

## Summary
`ClearingHouse.clear` enforces a `maxDuration` for loan requests. In practice, the loan owner can easily bypass this limit by calling `Cooler.roll` as many times as needed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The loan request can be made with a duration less than the `maxDuration`. `ClearingHouse.clear` calls `Cooler.clear` which sets `true` for `Loan.rollable`. The owner thus is now able to extend the loan term as much as he wants.

## Impact
Loan owners are able to bypass the `maxDuration` restriction in `ClearingHouse`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `ClearingHouse.clear`, call `Cooler.toggleRoll` just after the `Cooler.clear` call.
