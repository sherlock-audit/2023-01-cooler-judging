# Collateral can be locked forever because borrower can `roll` the loan many times

## Summary
Function `roll` in contract Cooler.sol is used to extend the loan at origination terms. There is no limit to the number of times that borrower can roll. If the borrower rolls too many times, the collateral can be locked forever in the contract. In the cases of small interest (close to 0), borrower can roll with no cost of collateral. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's see function `roll` in contract Cooler.sol
```solidity=
function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
    Request memory req = loan.request;

    if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
        revert Default();

    if (!loan.rollable)
        revert NotRollable();

    uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
    uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);

    loan.amount += newDebt;
    loan.expiry += req.duration;
    loan.collateral += newCollateral;

    collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
}
```
* The borrower can roll a loan many times because there is no limitation. 
* If the interest is too small (close to 0), `newCollateral` will be 0. Then borrower can roll with no cost of collateral, and extend the expiry to be very large.
* Contract `Cooler.sol` does not have any function to rescue the stuck tokens, so collateral will be locked forever in this case. It is very bad behavior that can not cover the accident cases from the lender.
## Impact
Collateral can be locked forever in some cases.
