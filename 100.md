# Anyone can roll a loan without a borrower's permission

## Summary

There is no access control preventing anyone from extending someone else's loan if a lender hasn't disabled rolling.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's take a scenario where a lender has enabled a loan to be rolled. Anyone else other than the lender could call the `roll` function and have the loan extended without the borrower's consent.

Let's say the price of the collateral token has gone up. The borrower could be forced to pay a higher unplanned interest which they may not be able to meet at a time when they want all their collateral back. This could be instigated by the lender or another malicious user.

## Impact

Borrower's loan could be extended with them having to pay more interest.
