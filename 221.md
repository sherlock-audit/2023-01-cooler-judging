# Debt token pauses may cause defaults

## Summary

Debt token pauses may cause defaults


## Vulnerability Detail

If the debt token is paused, any transaction trying to move the debt token will revert, including transactions attempting to repay the loan


## Impact

If the debt token is paused, the transaction attempting to repay the loan will revert, and eventually the loan will default. Later, once the token is unpaused, the lender will get to take the defaulted collateral, even though the user tried to make the payment.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.repay()   #1

122 @>         debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
123:           collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I don't see a way to prevent this, other than having a `tryRepay()` function which uses a try-catch, and marks the `Cooler` for third-party arbitration somehow, which would be extremely heavy-weight for an unlikely scenario.
