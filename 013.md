# Missing important functions for protocol front-end

## Summary
The current implementation for important state variables that the front-end need to consume miss some functions to work properly to display a lender all the possible Coolers he can choose to lend his tokens.
As statet in the [docs](https://ag0.gitbook.io/cooler-loan-code-walkthrough/borrower-flow) `we push the cooler address to our 'coolersFor' public mapping (used for front end purposes)` the front-end relys on the information what coolers exist for the collateral-debt combination.
With the current implementation the front-end can not display all the possible Coolers without extensive calls to the blockchain and also not the currently open Requests from a Cooler without extensive calls to the blockchain.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/main/src/Factory.sol#L23
https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L20
https://github.com/ohmzeus/Cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L29
```solidity
File: src/Factory.sol
23:     mapping(ERC20 => mapping(ERC20 => address[])) public coolersFor;

File: src/Cooler.sol
20:     Request[] public requests;

File: src/Cooler.sol
29:     Loan[] public loans;
```
All three have access over an array but no helper function to get the length of the array. Also they have no "getBulk" for easier query.

## Impact
The front-end can't get all the Coolers or all the Requests / Loans from a Caller in one call and also it's not possible for the front-end to know how many of them exist and how long it would take to get them all. So the front-end needs to start from index-0 and just query next, next until it gets an not exists.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add helper functions for the front-end like `collateralDebtLength` `requestsLength` `loansLength` and also maybe a bulk-fetch for them.

Example:

```solidity
function collateralDebtLength(address collateral, address debt) external returns (uint256) {
    return coolersFor[collateral][debt].length;
}

function getCoolersForCollateralDebt(address collateral, address debt, uint256 start, uint256 end) external returns ([]address memory _coolers) {
    // loop the coolersFor[collateral][debt] and return the coolers
}
```
