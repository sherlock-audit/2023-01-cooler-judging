# Borrowers can cancel loan while it is active

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The active variable with type bool is uninitialized in the code, which make it false as default per solidity standard, check here https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/types.html#delete
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/40559/what-are-the-initial-zero-values-for-different-data-types-in-solidity

## Impact

As used in this line of code, it is assumed that the bool active is true. However the active variable is uninitialized giving it a  false value by default. 

This would leads to borrowers able to cancel the loan even when it is active
