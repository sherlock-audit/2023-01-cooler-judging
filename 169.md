# Misunderstanding happen due to Doesn't check zero address

## Summary
Factory doesn't check zero address for collateral 

## Vulnerability Detail
If some person create pair `collateral=address(0)` and `debt=USDT` and create request  `1000usdt` for `1 ETH` (`some lender misunderstood address(0) as ETH`) borrower should able to pass request function because address(0) call is always success and never transfer any token or ETH as collateral. Now request is created and some lender might misunderstood `address(0)` as a `ETH` and fulfill the request.  

## Impact
Some Lender misunderstood and loss their debt token forever.
