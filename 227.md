# Borrower can roll the loan an arbitrary number of times, changing the terms of the loan by too much

## Summary
If a loan is rollable, a borrower can call `roll` multiple times extending the loan each time for the initial duration of the loan before the Lender can call `toggleRoll`, changing this way the terms of the loan much more than what the Lender could expect when he cleared it.

## Vulnerability Detail
If a Borrower creates a Cooler, for example with:

- $15,000
- 2% interest
- Duration: one year

When a lender decides to clear it, it is created with `rollable = true` by default, so the borrower can call multiple times the `roll` function and extend the loan to, let's say, ten years, before the Lender can call `toggleRoll` to prevent more extensions. This would change the terms of the request the Lender agreed upon too much, locking his debt tokens 10 times the time of the original request.

The Borrower would have to put collateral to cover the loan plus ten years of 2% interest ($22,289 worth of collateral), and would have ten times the original duration of the loan to return the debt.

## Tool used
Manual review.


## Recommendation
Make that any call to `roll` on a rollable loan toggles the value of `rollable` to false, giving control to the lender so that he can decide if he wants to let the borrower extend the loan in the future (via `toggleRoll`, and allowing the borrower to call roll only once everytime `rollable = true`.
