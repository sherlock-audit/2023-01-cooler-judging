# Wrong interest calculation if token decimals are not 18

## Summary

Interest calculation assumes token decimals will always be 18. This will lead to wrong calculation for tokens that use a different number of decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

Interest is calculated as:

```solidity
    function interestFor(uint256 amount, uint256 rate, uint256 duration) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 interest = rate * duration / 365 days;
        return amount * interest / decimals;
    }
```

where `uint256 private constant decimals = 1e18;`

There are tokens that use different decimals e.g `USDC` uses `6`. This will therefore lead to either inflating or deflating the interest dependent on token decimals.

## Impact

Loss of funds will result as interest can either be highly inflated or deflated.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Normalize the interest amount by calculating the decimal difference between tokens and then dividing the interest by the difference.
