# Any User can roll a loan for any loan-id

## Summary

As mentioned in the docs that https://ag0.gitbook.io/cooler-loans/servicing-and-default

From the docs: A borrower can also choose to roll their loan. This extends the loan at origination terms. This is done by calling the roll() function and specifying the loan identifier.


However, any user can call the roll for any loanid which will cause to increase the expiry time, the debt for a user.

## Vulnerability Detail


The roll function is not checking the msg.sender so any user can call the function. If this function was called by the attacker he can extend the lock, and increase the collateral for a user so that it will be harder to get his loan again.


## Impact

Increase expiry time and maybe lose initial collateral.

For example,
1. User A make a request for 1000 USDC as collateral for 1000 USDT.
2. User B clear and gives the user 1000 USDT.
3. Now User B roll many times until the debt cannot be paid by the user as it is too large.
4. When the time expiry finished and the default can be called the user will get the amount he roll and the 1000 USDC of the user.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L129-L147
```solidity
    function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
        Request memory req = loan.request;

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();

        if (!loan.rollable)
            revert NotRollable();

        uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
        uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);

        loan.amount += newDebt;
        loan.expiry += req.duration;
        loan.collateral += newCollateral;
        
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check that the one calling the function is the owner of the request and the one who gets the loan.
