# If `collateralFor=0` for the borrower but  the `loan.amount>0`, the borrower will steal funds

## Summary
Since  `collateralFor=0` and since `loan.amount > 0` the borrower can make a request  that the lender thinks is good and since of precision loss it   `collateralFor=0`
## Vulnerability Detail
since with precision loss `0.5= 0` in the evm and the lender will think they give 0.5 of the token but instead, the attacker gave 0, and then the lender will give them the debt tokens, and then when the loan defaults the lender won't be able to get their collateral because their no collateral in the contract. 
## Impact
Loss of funds

 when `collateralFor()` returns `0.5` or less the borrower can get a loan without putting up collateral
You might ask why would the lender clear the loan. Because the lender doesn't see that 0.5 in the evm is 0 and the collateral is supposed to be half a token.
spec:
>if loan amount is 1000 and loan to collateral is 2000 DAI per gOHM, the math is: 1000 / 2000 = 0.5


## Code Snippet
```solidity
      function test_attacker_steal_all_funds() public { 
        setUp();
        uint loanToCollateral = 20000000e18;
        uint amount =10000000;
        uint id =cooler.request(amount,interest,loanToCollateral,duration);
        dai.mint(address(victim), amount);
        dai.approve(address(this),amount);
        dai.approve(address(cooler),amount);
        assertEq(dai.balanceOf(address(this)),0);
        console.log(dai.balanceOf(address(this)));
        loansOut(id,amount);
        console.log(dai.balanceOf(address(this)));
        assert(dai.balanceOf(address(this))>0);
        uint burn_amount=gOHM.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint time_give_back = 365 days  + 365 days 
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Have the check be greater than zero or in  the `collateralFor` function, a better way to scale tokens is to  use universal 1e18
