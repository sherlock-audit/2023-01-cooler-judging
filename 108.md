# The lender must pay interest for the maximum loan period even if they pay off the loans early

## Summary

The lender must pay interest for the maximum loan period even if they pay off the loans early.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol describes the system as one in which a borrower pays a lender an interest rate for a loan. However, when a borrower pays a loan early, they are still charged as if they had borrowed for the maximum allowable time. 

For example: 

1. Borrower takes a loan with a 20% interest for a maximum of 365 days. 
2. Borrower repays debt after 1 day. 
3. Instead of getting charged for the 1 day in which they took the loan, they must pay the entire 20% interest.

## Impact

The borrowers overpays interest when they repay loan early.

## Recommendation

Alter the interest rate repayment such that borrower pays interest rate * (duration of loan) ending at the time the loan is repaid.
