# Use of non-standard compliant ERC20 tokens can lead to uncollateralized loans and wrong repayment values

## Summary
Depending on which tokens are used for debt and/or collateral, an malicious actor could harm possible lenders by creating uncollateralized loan request and also repaying less debt than specified on the loan request.

## Vulnerability Detail
Not all ERC20 implementations are compliant to the ERC20 spec, some implementations of `transfer` and `transferFrom` could return `false` on failure instead of reverting. Using those non-standard compliant ERC20 implementations as collateral and/or debt token could lead to exploits as functions like `request` and `repay` would succeed even if the caller doesn't have the required funds. 

## Impact
If  non-standard compliant ERC20 implementations are used, the following functions could be affected: `request`, `rescind`, `repay`, `roll`, `clear`, `defaulted`. Possibly putting funds at risk.

For example, an malicious actor would be able to call `request` and the loan request would succeed even if the `msg.sender` doesn't have enough funds to cover the collateral needed. Without a deep analysis of past transactions to the Cooler contract, the lender would be tricked into lending to this uncollaterized request.
Similarly an malicious actor would be able to call `repay` and it would succeed regardless of the actual balance of `msg.sender` debt tokens, possibly harming the lender as they would receive less tokens than expected.

## Recommendation
Consider using `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` from [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol), as they have appropriate checks for non-standard compliant tokens.
