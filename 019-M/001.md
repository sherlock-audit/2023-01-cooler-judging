# collateralFor function can be mainupalated to return 0.

## Summary
```collateralFor``` function can be mainupalated to return 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

Imagine this scenario:

* User creates request by passing 1000 as amount and 2000000000000000000000 as loanToCollateral
* collateralFor does this calculation: (1000 * 1e18) / 2000000000000000000000 which is equal to 0.5
* The function returns 0 because solidity rounds to floor
* ```collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));``` will not transfer anything because returned value is 0

## Impact

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add check for returned value to be not 0.
