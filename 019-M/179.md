# Stealing of Lender's tokens

## Summary
The math underlying collateralFor can be manipulated by an attacker to steal lender's tokens 

## Vulnerability Detail
The collateral for a loan is calculated by multiplying the requested amount by 1e18 and dividing it by the loanToCollateral
if amount is taken as 100 and loan to collateral 1000000000000000000000
100 x 1e18 =1000000000000000000000

1000000000000000000000 / 1000000000000000000000 = 0

Attacker could pass in this values in a request, and transfer nothing to the contract
 since the value of loanToCollateral has been set in the array an unsuspecting lender could get excited seeing the loanToCollateral and 
clear the request, the attacker gets 100 tokens while the lender gets nothing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Fix the mechanism behind determining the loans ,it's recommended a borrower should not be able to input the loanToCollateral, only the protocol should decide the amount of collateral for a given amount of tokens
