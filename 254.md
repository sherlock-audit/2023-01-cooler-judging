# Lender can reject receiving repayment through token hook, making the loan defaulted

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L122

## Vulnerability Detail
In function `repay()`, it will transferred debt token from sender directly to lender. If debt is an ERC20 token that has a hook to receiver, lender can use this hook to reject receiving funds, making the loan defaulted. 


## Impact
The result is borrower cannot repay, loan will default and borrower lose collateral.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
    if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
        revert Default();

    uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

    if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID]; 
    else {
        loan.amount -= repaid;
        loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
    }

    debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
    // @audit lender can reject receiving transfer if debt is token with hook
    collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
}
```
