# `toggleRoll()` may be frontran

## Summary

The `toggleRoll()` function may be frontran. An attacker can watch the mempool for transactions that disable rolling their loans, and then frontrun those transactions with ones rolling the loan, thus subverting the lender's wishes.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a lender clears a loan, the loan is rollable by default. The lender then has to send another transaction to toggle off the loan's rollability. A malicious debtor can watch the mempool for this second transaction and roll the loan before it is toggled off.

New loans are rollable by default.

## Impact

Loans are rolled even if lenders wish them never to be.

## Code Snippet

N/A, requires mempool monitoring code

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a parameter to the `clear()` function in `Cooler.sol` that allows an attacker to specify at clearing time that they wish a loan not to be rollable. This way their intentions cannot be maliciously subverted while they send two transactions, one to initiate the loan and a second to toggle rollability.
