# Discrepancy in decimals

## Summary
The protocol does not account for potential discrepancies in collateral and debt token decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calculating the collateral, it multiplies the debt amount by a default value of 18 decimals and divides by the LTC ratio:
```solidity
    uint256 private constant decimals = 1e18;
```
```solidity
   function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
    }
```

Some popular tokens have a lower number of decimals, e.g. USDC has 6, and WBTC has 8. If for example, I want to borrow 1 USDC (```1e6```), even with the lowest possible LTC ratio, I will have to put the collateral of:
```1e6 * 1e18 / 1 = 1e24```.
This requirement does not account for the decimals of the collateral token.

## Impact
This makes it impractical to pair with collateral that also has low decimals, e.g. the aforementioned WBTC. The LTC ratio can be adjusted but even with the minimal value (1) this issue is present. Thus the protocol will be unable to support many popular tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When creating a new Cooler it should query the decimals of both tokens and adjust them when doing the calculations.
