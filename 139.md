# Anyone could claim the collateral from any loan

## Summary
The `defaulted()` function in `Cooler.sol` contract didn'tcheck to verify if the `msg.sender` is the lender of the loan. This is dangerous because anyone could call this function and claim the collateral from any loan even if they are not the lender. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This can be a problem if the collateral is transferred to a malicious address, which could then be used to further attack the smart contract or the collateral is transferred to an address that is not the lender's address.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L198

## Impact
```solidity
function defaulted (uint256 loanID) external returns (uint256) {
        Loan memory loan = loans[loanID];
        delete loans[loanID];

        if (block.timestamp <= loan.expiry) 
            revert NoDefault();

        collateral.transfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
        return loan.collateral;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommended to add a check to verify if the msg.sender is the lender of the loan before allowing the transfer of the collateral.
