# Debt and collateral ERC20 tokens are assumed to have the same decimal places

## Summary

The debt and collateral ERC20 tokens are assumed to have the same decimal places (i.e. floating point precision). The assumption would lead to incorrect accounting and potential loss of funds if the 2 tokens did not have the same decimal places.

## Vulnerability Detail

Neither Cooler.sol nor Factory.sol compare the decimals property of the 2 tokens that are given as parameters when constructing a fresh Cooler contract. But other parts of the code assume that the property is the same for both tokens, e.g.
```solidity
    function collateralFor(uint256 amount, uint256 loanToCollateral) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return amount * decimals / loanToCollateral;
    }
```
This function takes in an amount of debt token and converts that to an equivalent amount of collateral token given some conversion ratio. Let's make the assumption that the conversion ratio is precise up to 18 decimals (to avoid confusion). This means that if the precision of the `amount` variable is the same as that of the return value. A call to this function can be found in the `request` function:
```solidity
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
```
if the collateral token does not share the same precision as the debt token then this line will try to transfer the incorrect amount of collateral tokens from `msg.sender` (which is most likely going to be the owner).

## Impact

Arguably the impact here is not so serious because it is only affecting the owner, which has full control of the requests made and can thus adjust for this bug by adjusting the `loanToCollateral` parameter. But if the owner does not know about this bug and a loan is defaulted this could lead to a more-than-expected loss of funds for the owner, which is rather serious.

The owner also has control over which debt/collateral tokens are used to deploy the Cooler contracts and so one could argue that the owner should just not use tokens that differ in precision (decimals).

So this could be anywhere from high to not a threat at all. I'm really not sure.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either perform a check in Cooler.sol/Factory.sol making sure the 2 tokens share the same decimals, or adjust the accounting so that it can handle tokens with differing decimals.
