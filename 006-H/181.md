# gjaldon - Lender can get Cooler owner's collateral for free

## Summary

If debt token set for the Cooler contract is an ERC20 token that does not revert on transfer failure and instead returns false, the Lender can get free collateral tokens from the Cooler owner. This is leads to a loss funds for the Cooler owner and gain of funds for the Lender.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Cooler owner deploys contract with an ERC20 token that does not revert on transfer failure as the `debt` token.
2. Owner/borrower calls `Cooler.request` providing collateral tokens and creating a loan request.
3. Exploiter calls `Cooler.clear(reqId)` with the request that has collateral tokens. It succeeds even though no debt tokens were transferred to the owner. This is because the debt token returns false on failed transfers but there is no code that checks that.
4. If owner notices that the loan request was granted but no debt tokens were sent to his address, he will need to `repay` the amount + interest to get the collateral back. If the owner is savvy, he can recover the collateral without loss by exploiting the same issue in `repay`.
5. If owner does not notice the loan request anomaly and the loan defaults, the exploiter can `defaulted(loanId)` on the loan and seize the collateral himself. 

## Impact
This is a high-impact finding since it can lead to a loss of funds for the victim Owner. The exploit is also cheap to run for the exploiter since it only needs gas and 0 capital.

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library and use safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer instead of transfer and transferFrom.
