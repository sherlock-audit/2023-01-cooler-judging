# gjaldon - Cooler owner can get free loans with zero collateral

## Summary

Cooler owner can request for loans without sending collateral due to the use of `collateral.transferFrom`. Since some ERC20 tokens do not revert on failure and just return false, the `request` function will still succeed as if the owner had provided collateral. A lender that `clear`s the loan request will lose all the funds lent to the Cooler owner. 

## Vulnerability Detail
If an ERC20 token that does not revert on failed transfer is used as collateral for a Cooler, a user can the do the following:
1. Exploiter successfully deploys a Cooler contract with the exploiter as the owner.
2. The collateral token used does not revert on failed transfers and only returns false. 
3. Exploiter calls `Cooler.request` with an attractive interest rate, loanToCollateral ratio, and a huge amount to loan. Even though exploiter has only 0 collateral tokens, the transaction does not fail because the collateral token does not revert on failure and only returns `false`. Since the transaction succeeded, a loan `request` is still created for a huge amount.
4. A lender sees the loan request and finds the terms attractive. The lender calls `clear(reqId)` for that loan request and it succeeds ending with the debt tokens being sent from lender to the exploiter.
5. Exploiter does not bother repaying loan since he provided 0 collateral. Exploiter got free money.

## Impact
This is a high-impact finding since it can lead to huge loss of funds for the victim lender. The exploit is also cheap to run for the exploiter since it only needs gas and 0 capital.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library and use safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer instead of transfer and transferFrom.
