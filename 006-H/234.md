# Borrower can steal debt tokens from the lender

## Summary
If the collateral token does not revert on a failing transfer, a lender is able to request a loan transferring zero collateral, and then steal the debt tokens from the lender when he clears it. Also, if the debt token does not revert on error, the attacker borrower could repay a loan transferring zero debt tokens to the lender.

## Vulnerability Detail
Certain ERC20 tokens don't revert when there is an error. So, if the collateral token is one of these, a lender can create a `Cooler`, request a loan without transferring the collateral (because there is no check that the transfer of collateral succeeded), and then trick a naive Lender that would clear the loan, transferring debt tokens to the attacker (see line 85 below):
```solidity
74: function request (
75: 	uint256 amount,
76: 	uint256 interest,
77: 	uint256 loanToCollateral,
78: 	uint256 duration
79: ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
80: 	reqID = requests.length;
81: 	factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
82: 	requests.push(
83: 		Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
84: 	);
85: 	collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
86: }
```

Alternatively, if the debt token was the one that does not revert on error (but the collateral token does), the attacker could request a loan transferring the needed collateral, wait for a lender to clear it, and then repaying it with 0 debt tokens, as the return of the transfer in the `repay` function is also not check for success (see line 122 below):

```solidity
108: function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
109: 	Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
110:
111: 	if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
112: 		revert Default();
113: 
114: 	uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
115: 
116: 	if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
117: 	else {
118: 		loan.amount -= repaid;
119: 		loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
120: 	}
121: 
122: 	debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
123: 	collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
124: }
```
