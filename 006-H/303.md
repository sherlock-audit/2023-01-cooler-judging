# unsafe ERC20 operations.

## Summary

Cooler and Clearinghouse contracts are using `transfer` and `transferFrom` to send the funds to the respective address.

The issue here is, for some tokens, the success status of the transaction will be decided by the return status of the the transfer operation.

Since the contract is not checking the status of the transaction, when the actual transfer fails for some tokens, updating the subsequent status like loan value would not be safe

Please refer the below link that I examined to know more.

## Vulnerability Detail

Kindly refer the summary section.

## Impact

Even if the transfer fails, it will be marked as valid and subsequent updates are done, like updating the loan value etc..

This is not safe to the protocol.
