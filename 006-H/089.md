# Unsafe call to ERC20::transfer can result in Fund loss

## Summary
 
## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 implementations' (e.g. USDT, BNB, OMG) `transfer` function returns bool indicating whether the transfer was successful or not instead of reverting . 

## Impact
Call will pass even though contract could not send the tokens to the user successfully and will result in user's funds stuck forever.
