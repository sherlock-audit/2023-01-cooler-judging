# Cooler does not handle all token transfers

## Summary
Cooler does not support non-Openzeppelin ERC20 implementations

## Vulnerability Detail
In Cooler.sol, there are several functions that make use of the `transferFrom` and `transfer` functions. None, of which are checked for success. It is assumed that Cooler intends to use Openzeppelin's ERC20 implementation, which reverts on **unsuccessful** "transfers". Although, Openzeppelin's implementation is widely used, there are other implementations as well which return `boolean` values upon successful or unsuccessful transfers (such case is the [ZRX token]( https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code%23L64)). 

It is unclear what tokens are intended to be used as collateral by the protocol itself, but since Cooler is intended to be use in a decentralized manner, all tokens must be considered.

## Impact
Functions that use `transfer` and `transferFrom` will be impacted. An example is `request()`. In this specific case, a new `Request` is created even if a collateral token fails to be transferred. This means that potentially a non-collateralized loan can be given.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using Openzeppelin's SafeERC20 library for future proofing.
