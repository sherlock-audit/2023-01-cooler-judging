# Empty Requests / Empty Loans For Some ERC20s

## Summary

There are unchecked `transferFrom`s ([L85](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L85); [L179](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L179)) in [Cooler.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol) which allow borrowers and/or lenders to fake deposits. Not all ERC20s revert on failure of their `transferFrom` function. For example, [STASIS EURO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdB25f211AB05b1c97D595516F45794528a807ad8#code) returns `false` if an address is blocked. There are many reasons an ERC20 `transferFrom` may fail and if a malicious user knows how to trigger a failure they can take assets from the lender or borrower. 

## Vulnerability Detail

A borrower can fake collateral in a request if using an ERC20 that fails on `transferFrom` [L85](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L85) (does not revert but returns `false`). A lender can fake debt deposits if using an ERC20 that fails on `transferFrom` [L179](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L179) (does not revert but returns `false`).  

## Impact

A borrower may be able to get free loans through the use of some ERC20s. A lender may be able to not send debt to a borrower through the use of some ERC20s.

## Code Snippet

**Borrowers**
```solidity
74:    function request (
75:        uint256 amount,
76:        uint256 interest,
77:        uint256 loanToCollateral,
78:        uint256 duration
79:    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
80:        reqID = requests.length;
81:        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
82:        requests.push(
83:            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
84:        );
85:        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
86:    }
```

**Lenders**
```solidity
162:    function clear (uint256 reqID) external returns (uint256 loanID) {
163:        Request storage req = requests[reqID];
164:
165:        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Clear);
166:
167:        if (!req.active) 
168:            revert Deactivated();
169:        else req.active = false;
170:
171:        uint256 interest = interestFor(req.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
172:        uint256 collat = collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral);
173:        uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + req.duration;
174:
175:        loanID = loans.length;
176:        loans.push(
177:            Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
178:        );
179:        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);
180:    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the return value of `transferFrom`.
