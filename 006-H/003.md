# Protocol doesn't check the result of ERC20.transfer calls

## Summary
Protocol doesn't check the result of ERC20.transfer calls. Because of that it's possible that transfer will fail and protocol will not notice that.
## Vulnerability Detail
Inside Cooler contract everywhere protocol uses ERC20 `transferFrom` function and ignores result of operation.

This can lead to a serious problem in case if any transfer will return false value.
In such case Cooler contract will stop working as expected.

For example if lender calls `clear` and nothing was sent to borrower, then borrower will lost all his deposited funds for free.
Otherwise if borrower calls `request` and nothing was sent, then the lender will likely lose his funds.
## Impact
Loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use safe transfer lib in order to cover both ERC20 contracts that return bool param and not or just check result of transfer call.
