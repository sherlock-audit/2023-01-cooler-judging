# Unsafe usage of `ERC20.transfer` and `ERC20.transferFrom`

## Summary
The `ERC20.transfer` and `ERC20.transferFrom` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value (e.g. USDT).

## Impact
An attacker could create a cooler and create a request without actually sending the collateral to the contract. Therefore, any lender calling `clear` would loose his debt tokens.
A borrower could create a cooler with a non standard token like USDT as collateral or debt which would revert as the casted ERC20 interface require a returned boolean value that USDT does not have. Therefore, he would need to redeploy a new cooler contract with a different token.

## Code Snippet
[Cooler.sol#L85](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L85)
```solidity
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
```
[Cooler.sol#L102](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L102)
```solidity
        collateral.transfer(owner, collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
```
[Cooler.sol#L122-L123](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L122-L123)
```solidity
        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
        collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
```

[Cooler.sol#L146](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L146)
```solidity
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
```
[Cooler.sol#L179](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L179)
```solidity
        debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, req.amount);
```

[Cooler.sol#L205](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L205)
```solidity
        collateral.transfer(loan.lender, loan.collateral);
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` functions that handle the return value check as well as tokens that do not follow the ERC20 standard.
