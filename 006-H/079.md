# No check on `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` return values

No check on `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` return values

## Summary

The protocol uses `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` return values in multiple functions without checking the return value.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success.  Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec, like USDT, will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.  Silent failures of transfers can occur and affect token accounting in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a `require()` statement that checks the return value of ERC20 token transfers or use OpenZeppelin’s `safeTransfer()` / `safeTransferFrom()`
