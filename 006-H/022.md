# Unsafe ERC20 usage: If one of the token is a non-revert on transfer, the other token can be stolen.

## Summary

The Cooler contract uses unsafe ERC20 transfer operations, which opens an attack vector that allows stealing funds of the other token (under certain (but not unlikely) conditions).

## Vulnerability Detail

There are ERC20 tokens that do not revert on failed transfers, but will just silently succeed without transferring anything. As a result, transfers for such tokens will result in wrong accounting. An example of such is the ZRX token: https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L64

This will become an attack vector. We present possible scenarios on which this can happen:

### The unsafe token is the collateral

- Alice makes a borrow request. She transfers some unsafe collateral, but she intentionally makes the transfer fail. 
    - The collateral is never transferred, but the request is created.
- Alice has created a honeypot attack: anyone who accepts the loan now is subject to bad debt, as the Cooler instance is now under-collateralized.

### The unsafe token is the debt

- Alice has some (safe) collateral, and wants to borrow the (unsafe) debt token. She creates a borrow request.
- Anyone (even with zero balance) can now accept the request. Since the debt token is unsafe, Alice does not receive any debts, and will lose her collateral when she inevitably defaults due to carrying an unrepayable debt.

## Impact

If one of the tokens is a non-revert on transfer, funds can be stolen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library, which correctly handles unusual behavior ERC20 tokens, and certainly reverts on failed transfers. 

Alternatively, the sponsor may use other methods as sanity checks for a successful token transferring.
