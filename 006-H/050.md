# Borrower can request a loan without transferring the collateral assets, hence can steal the lender funds

## Summary
Borrower can intentionally trick the lender into paying the debt assets without having the underlying collateral in the Cooler smart contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens don't throw but just return false when transfer fails. This can be abused to trick the `request()` function to intialize a request without providing any collateral tokens. 

ERC20 tokens like [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L112) can be good example here. 

```solidity 
    function request (
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interest,
        uint256 loanToCollateral,
        uint256 duration
    ) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
        reqID = requests.length;
        factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
        requests.push(
            Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
        );
        // fails silently as borrower don't hold enough
        collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral)); 
    }
```
This can be exploited by generating a new Cooler contract from the factory with ZRX as collateral token(as it don't revert on fail transfers) and then request a loan amount with promising high interest rate, which catch the eyes of lender. 

Once the loan has been cleared by lender which eventually be, as its the best deal out there, the funds will transferred to the borrower. 

## Impact
borrower owned the lender assets without supplying the underlying collateral, lender lose the funds

## Recommendation
Consider using `safeTransferFrom()` from OpenZeppelin, it will revert if transfers fails.
