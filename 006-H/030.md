# ERC20 tokens with special transfer are not handled correctly

## Summary

Calls to `ERC20#transfer` and `ERC20#transferFrom` methods should always be checked.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens do not revert on failure in transfer but instead return false as a return value (for example ZRX).
Other tokens (like USDT) don't correctly implement the EIP20 standard and their transfer/ transferFrom function return void instead of a success boolean.

## Impact
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer are still counted as valid funds accounting.

## Recommendation
Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
