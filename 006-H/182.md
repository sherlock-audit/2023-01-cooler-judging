# Protocol may ignore failed transfers

## Summary

Failed calls to `transfer` and `transferFrom` may not be detected, leading to incorrect behavior when lending funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are many places where the protocol assumes that a call to `transfer` or `transferFrom` succeeded if they did not revert. If a token is used that returns `false` on failed transfers instead of reverting, the protocol may erroneously assume that failed transfers actually succeeded. For example, take the `clear` function:

If the return value from `transferFrom` is not checked, the loan may be marked as cleared even though no funds were lent.

## Impact

Loss of funds. Funds may be "lent" or "repaid" without actually completing a transfer.

## Recommendation

Use the OpenZeppelin safeerc20 library for all calls to ERC20 tokens, which will detect these failure modes.
