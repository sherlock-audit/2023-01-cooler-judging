# Use of unsafe ERC20

## Summary
Project using ```trasfer()```, ```trasferFrom()``` instead of using ```safeTransfer()```, ```safeTrasferFrom()```

## Vulnerability Detail
The contest context saying that project supports all type of ERC20 ```ERC20: Any```,
But some popular tokens like ```USDT``` adapt ERC20 standard differently, instead of reverting on failure of ```trasfer()``` & ```trasferFrom()```, it returns false.

But there is no checks on return value of  ```trasfer()```, ```trasferFrom()``` in whole codebase.
```solidity
collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral)); 
```
```solidity
collateral.transfer(owner, collateralFor(req.amount, req.loanToCollateral));
```

So user can easily manipulate, or even steal funds by using those type of tokens.

## Impact
User can manipulate project logic easily, even his failed transaction can consider as a successful transaction by protocol, when user use tokens like USDT which adapt ERC20 differently.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If you are intended to use all types of ERC20, then you should use Openzeppelin's safeERC20 library, which handle these type of error properly.
