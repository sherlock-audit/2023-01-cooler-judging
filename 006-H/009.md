# USE SAFETRANSFER/SAFETRANSFERFROM CONSISTENTLY INSTEAD OF TRANSFER/TRANSFERFROM

## Summary
ERC20 implementations are not always consistent and could behave unexpectedly, reverting the transaction for certain tokens. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The Cooler protocol does not set any restriction to which ERC20 tokens can be used in the protocol. Some token implementations of `transfer` and `transferFrom` could return ‘false’ on failure instead of reverting. It is good to add a `require()` statement that checks the return value of token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelin’s `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect the protocol's behavior, updating protocol state as if tokens were properly transferred even if they failed to do so.

## Code Snippet
`transfer`/`transferFrom` functions are used instead of `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` on the following contracts:

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` methods, or wrap current `transfer`/`transferFrom` methods in a require() statement consistently.
