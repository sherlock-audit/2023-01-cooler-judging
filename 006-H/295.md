# no-revert-on-transfer ERC20 tokens not supported

## Summary

Some ERC20 tokens don't throw but just return false when a transfer fails. This can be abused in different parts of the protocol, as `transfer` and `transferFrom` is used to transfer ERC20 tokens instead of `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom`.

For example, a borrower could create a new loan request without providing the collateral, using the `request()` function in `Cooler.sol`

An example of such a token is *ZRX*: [[Etherscan code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L64)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L64)

## Vulnerability Detail

When requesting a new loan, collateral is transferred from msg.sender to the Cooler contract. In case of a ‘no-revert-on-transfer’ collateral token the `transferFrom()` might return false, which means the token transfer failed (instead of reverting). As the return value is not checked in this `request()` function, the user might successfully create a loan request (and receive debt tokens if a lender clears the loan request), without providing any collateral.

```solidity
function request (
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 interest,
    uint256 loanToCollateral,
    uint256 duration
) external returns (uint256 reqID) {
    reqID = requests.length;
    factory.newEvent(reqID, CoolerFactory.Events.Request);
    requests.push(
        Request(amount, interest, loanToCollateral, duration, true)
    );
    collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralFor(amount, loanToCollateral));
}
```

## Impact

In case one of the supported collateral tokens is a ‘no-revert-on-transfer’ token, Users might be able to create new loans and receive debt tokens without providing any collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace each occurrence of `transferFrom` in `safeTransferFrom` and each occurrence of `transfer` in `safeTransfer`. These functions are included in OZ’s `SafeERC20` contract: [https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol)

Alternatively, wrap the `tranfer`/`transferFrom` in a require statement:
