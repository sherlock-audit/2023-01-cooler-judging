# Transfer/TransferFrom return values are not checked.

## Summary
Unsafe transfer/transferFrom calls should have their return values checked.

## Vulnerability Detail
Not all tokens will revert on failure/return true on success (such as USDT) and should have their return values checked to ensure transfer is successful. 
An example where funds could be lost is if the collateral is a standard token and the debt is one that can fail silently, a user could call Cooler.request and successfully send their collateral to a lender, but the [transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L179)  in clear could fail silently. They would then have an open loan with their collateral at stake but never have received the debt tokens.

## Impact
A borrower could have an open loan without receiving any debt tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either check the return value of the transfers/transferFroms or use a safe version such as openZeppelin's [SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) library.
